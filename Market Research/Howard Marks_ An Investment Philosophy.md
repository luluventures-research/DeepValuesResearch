# **Howard Marks: An Investment Philosophy**

### **1\. The First Principle: The Primacy of Defense**

Every investor, whether they articulate it or not, makes a foundational choice that governs their entire approach: whether to focus on picking more winners or on avoiding losers. This single decision is the most critical determinant of a long-term investment strategy and its resulting performance profile. It dictates not just how one invests, but the very mindset required to navigate the inevitable cycles of euphoria and despair that define the markets.

The choice is between a skillful aggressive approach, which seeks superior results by having more of the things that go up, and a skillful defensive approach, which seeks the same goal by having fewer of the things that go down. While it is theoretically possible to do both, very few investors possess the temperament and toolkit to master both aggression and defense simultaneously. Therefore, a conscious choice must be made. Our philosophy is rooted in the latter: a steadfast commitment to defense.

This conviction was cemented by a seminal anecdote from a dinner in 1990 with the head of the General Mills pension fund. He shared that over the preceding 14 years, his equity portfolio had never ranked above the 27th percentile in any single year, nor had it ever ranked below the 47th. It was a picture of consistent, solid, but unspectacular performance. And yet, the profound result was that for the 14-year period taken as a whole, the fund’s record was in the fourth percentile.

The mathematical lesson is profound and inescapable: avoiding major losses is a more reliable path to long-term superior performance than swinging for the fences. Most investors occasionally shoot for the stars, but in doing so, they also occasionally shoot themselves in the foot, wrecking their long-term record. A large loss is devastatingly difficult to recover from. This simple truth gave birth to our guiding motto:

If you can avoid the losers, the winners will take care of themselves.

This principle translates into a focus on "steady excellence" rather than the pursuit of spectacular but unreliable gains. It is a philosophy born not from a lack of ambition, but from a deep respect for the inherent nature of the investment environment itself.

### **2\. Understanding the Nature of the Game: Acknowledging Uncertainty and Risk**

A winning strategy must be congruent with the realities of the game being played. In investing, that game is overwhelmingly characterized by randomness, uncertainty, and a lack of control over outcomes. To ignore this reality is to court disaster. The key is to understand the nature of the game and to play it accordingly.

As the great financial writer Charlie Ellis observed, investing is best understood as a "loser's game," much like amateur tennis. In professional tennis, players must actively hit winners to win points, as their opponents are too skilled to make unforced errors. The amateur game is the opposite. The winner is typically the player who simply avoids mistakes, keeping the ball in play until their opponent self-destructs by hitting it into the net or out of bounds. Due to the significant role of randomness and unknowable future events, investors are far more like amateurs in this regard. Trying to hit winners often leads to unforced errors that can take you out of the game entirely.

In this environment, survival is paramount. The goal is not merely to do well on average, but to endure the inevitable downturns. This is best illustrated by the metaphor of the 6-foot-tall person who drowned crossing a stream that was 5 feet deep on average. The notion of surviving on average is meaningless; you must survive every single day to reach the finish line. Surviving the worst days means structuring a portfolio that can withstand the real-world pressures of forced selling from withdrawals or margin calls. A portfolio built only to maximize gains on hopeful assumptions exposes itself to being wiped out when those assumptions prove wrong.

This brings us to a critical trade-off. There is no strategy that simultaneously maximizes gains in good times while providing robust protection in bad times. An investor must consciously choose whether to optimize for upside capture or downside protection. Our philosophy is not one of *risk avoidance*—which is synonymous with return avoidance—but of the *intelligent bearing of risk*. The goal is a thoughtful, deliberate engagement with risk, structured to ensure that we are still standing after the storm has passed. Given this environment of uncertainty, a disciplined and adaptable decision-making framework is essential for survival and success.

### **3\. A Disciplined Framework for Decision-Making**

Navigating an uncertain world where survival is the primary objective requires a structured approach to decision-making. A sound philosophy is not an abstract concept; it is a practical guide that informs action (and inaction) day to day. Our framework is centered on self-awareness, cyclical positioning through observation, and a profound respect for the strategic value of patience.

#### **3.1 Calibrating a Deliberate Risk Posture**

The first step is to establish a "normal" risk posture. Imagine a speedometer where 0 represents no risk (and no return) and 100 represents the maximum possible risk. Every individual and institution must determine where on this continuum they should normally operate. This baseline calibration is a function of numerous factors:

* Age  
* Wealth  
* Income and needs  
* Number of dependents  
* Proximity to retirement  
* Intestinal fortitude

While the first several factors can be quantified, that last one—intestinal fortitude—is often the most critical and the most difficult to assess honestly. It is the ability to endure psychological pressure when markets turn against you, and a failure to understand its limits is a primary source of investor error. Once this baseline is established, the next strategic decision is whether to remain static or to vary this posture over time. We believe there are rare but important moments when the opportunities and dangers presented by the market warrant a deliberate shift away from this normal setting.

#### **3.2 Mastering the Market Cycle Through Observation, Not Prediction**

We operate on the fundamental belief that while the macro future is unknowable, the market’s present condition is not. We do not make forecasts, but we do make observations. This is encapsulated in one of our most important mantras:

We never know where we're going, but we sure as hell ought to know where we are.

This process involves "taking the temperature" of the market. This is not an economic forecast, but an assessment of the behavior of the people around us. Are market participants exuberant, carefree, and dismissive of risk? Or are they fearful, depressed, and pessimistic? The perfect articulation of how to react to that assessment comes from Warren Buffett: "the less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we must conduct our affairs."

The goal of this assessment is to "get the odds on your side." When markets are high in their cycle—characterized by high valuations, narrow risk spreads, and widespread optimism—the odds are against investors. Conversely, when markets are low in their cycle, the odds are in your favor. This assessment dictates when it is prudent to become more defensive or more aggressive than our normal posture. These moments are exceedingly rare; one might only make five such major calls over a 50-year career. This underscores the need to wait patiently for compelling, high-probability opportunities to present themselves.

#### **3.3 The Strategic Value of Inactivity**

In most fields, the impulse is to act. For investing, we invert the popular saying:

Don't just do something, sit there.

Overtrading is one of the greatest dangers an investor faces. It is not only costly in terms of commissions and taxes, but it is often profoundly counterproductive, driven by emotion—buying at the highs in a state of excitement and selling at the lows in a state of depression. There is a (perhaps apocryphal) study of Fidelity accounts that found the best-performing portfolios belonged to people who were deceased. The lesson, however, is powerful: the discipline to avoid meddling is a significant advantage.

We prefer the baseball analogy of waiting for a good pitch. An investor must have a clear sense of what kind of investment meets their criteria and then wait patiently for it to appear. But the comparison to baseball ends at a crucial point that makes all the difference for an investor: unlike in baseball, in investing you don’t get called out on strikes. This single distinction enables an almost infinite capacity for patience. One can wait indefinitely for an investment that is squarely in one's sweet spot without penalty.

A defensive framework built on risk calibration, patient observation, and strategic inactivity is not merely a formula for survival. It is the necessary precondition that earns us the right to proactively pursue superior returns.

### **4\. The Pursuit of Superior Returns: The Necessity of an Edge**

In a highly competitive field populated by intelligent, hardworking, and motivated participants, consistently achieving above-average results cannot be a matter of luck. It must stem from a durable and identifiable advantage—an "edge." Without an edge, investing is no different from trying to predict a fair coin toss with a supercomputer; as the source of that analogy explains, "it can't be done. It's a waste of time because there's no edge."

Superior results demand a "knowledge advantage." As we wrote in our earliest days, the directive is to:

study the micro like mad in order to know your subject better than others.

This advantage is most potent when applied in a "less efficient market," which we define simply as a market where hard work, skill, and superior insight can pay off because information is not perfectly or evenly distributed.

A clear historical example was our entry into the high-yield ("junk") bond market in 1978\. At the time, this asset class was "reputationally and politically unpalatable," and most people "wouldn't touch them with a 10-foot pole." For 18 years, major public pension funds—the largest pools of capital—would not invest there. This widespread aversion created an environment where an entire asset class was available to us that others would not buy at any price. It was an arena ripe for bargains for those willing to do the analytical work.

This stands in stark contrast to the "Nifty50" stocks of the late 1960s. These were universally acclaimed as the greatest companies in America, which at the time "everybody thought they were the greatest thing since sliced bread." The result of this consensus was extreme overvaluation, which led to catastrophic losses of roughly 95% for investors who held them over the subsequent five years. This illustrates the immense danger of consensus and the opportunity found in dissent. Superior performance is therefore found by applying deep, specialized knowledge in areas that are overlooked, misunderstood, or disdained by the broader market.

### **5\. Core Tenets: A Summary of Guiding Beliefs**

Our philosophy is not a collection of market timing rules, but a set of unwavering tenets that guide our behavior in all market conditions. These principles provide the intellectual and temperamental foundation for a consistent, repeatable process.

* **Humility is Essential** We are guided by the wisdom of Mark Twain:  
* Acknowledging that the future is an unknowable probability distribution, not a single predictable outcome, is the best defense against the kind of certainty that leads to catastrophic error.  
* **Survival is the Only Path to Long-Term Success** You must survive every single day in order to reach the finish line. Portfolios constructed to maximize gains based on hopeful assumptions expose themselves to wipeout risk. Our first priority is to ensure we are positioned to endure the worst days, so we can be present to enjoy the better ones.  
* **Idiosyncratic Thinking is Required** Great investing and bureaucracy are incompatible. Superior results often require unconventional, contrarian actions that cannot survive by committee. As David Swenson of Yale so brilliantly articulated:  
* This is not an abstract theory. In the fourth quarter of 2008, after Lehman Brothers collapsed and most believed the financial world was ending, we faced a choice. With ten billion dollars of dry powder, we had to decide whether to act. There was no way to analyze the future. So my partner Bruce Karsh and I figured out that we should spend the money. He bravely invested an average of $450 million a week for the next 15 weeks—a total of nearly $7 billion in a single quarter when others were paralyzed by fear. That is idiosyncratic thinking in action.  
* **Patience is a Strategic Asset** Economies grow and companies improve over time. The most important thing for investors is to "get on that gravy train and stay on it." The discipline to wait for compelling opportunities and to avoid tampering with a sound portfolio is far more important than the constant, frenetic search for action.

These tenets combine to form a consistent, repeatable process designed to navigate markets, manage risk, and compound capital over the long term.

### **6\. Conclusion: A Commitment to a Deliberate and Enduring Process**

This is more than a strategy; it is a constitution. It is the creed that has guided us through panics and manias alike, a commitment to a process that is, by design, defensive, risk-controlled, contrarian, and disciplined. It is grounded in a humble respect for uncertainty and an unwavering focus on avoiding the errors that fell the majority of investors. We do not believe it is the only way to invest, but it is our way, and we have adhered to it through every market cycle.

Ultimately, we are guided by the measure of success articulated by the writer Christopher Morley, a quote that serves as the North Star for our entire endeavor:

There is only one success—to be able to live your life in your own way.
