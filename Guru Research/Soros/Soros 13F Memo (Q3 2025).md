### Soros 13F MEMORANDUM

**TO:**  Internal Review Board  **FROM:**  Office of the Chief Investment Officer  **DATE:**  October 2025  **SUBJECT:**  Strategic Rationale for Q3 2025 Concentrated Technology Allocations

##### 1.0 The Strategic Mandate: Concentrated Conviction in a Bifurcated World

This memorandum articulates the deliberate strategic thesis underpinning Soros Fund Management's (SFM) significant and concentrated capital deployment into mega-cap technology stocks during the third quarter of 2025\. These high-conviction positions are not a passive overweighting but a direct expression of our unified macroeconomic outlook, our long-standing investment philosophy, and the unique structural advantages afforded by our permanent capital base. The following sections will deconstruct this thesis, beginning with the macroeconomic landscape that provides the canvas upon which our core investment philosophy is applied.

##### 2.0 Macroeconomic Thesis: Navigating the Great Bifurcation

Our portfolio construction begins not with security selection, but with a clear-eyed macroeconomic worldview. We contend that aggregate economic data is dangerously misleading, masking a deep bifurcation in the U.S. economy that necessitates a portfolio precisely targeted at segments experiencing growth while simultaneously hedging against the fragility of the whole.

* **The "Top 10%" Expansion:**  We observe a robust and sustained spending environment among the top decile of earners, a cohort that accounts for approximately 50% of total U.S. consumption. This expansion is fueled by a powerful wealth effect transmitted through high equity valuations and resilient housing prices, allowing this group to absorb higher costs without curtailing discretionary spending.  
* **The "Bottom 90%" Recession:**  For the vast majority of the population, economic reality is recessionary. This cohort has seen real wages eroded by inflation, pandemic-era savings fully depleted, and access to credit severely constrained by prohibitive interest rates on credit cards and auto loans.This bifurcated view informs our contrarian stance on interest rates. While the market consensus has anticipated multiple rate cuts, we have positioned for a "higher for longer" environment, reasoning that the current administration demonstrates a higher tolerance for economic pain and market volatility than its predecessors. Furthermore, we assess the primary risk of rising protectionism and tariffs differently than the consensus. While many fear an inflationary spiral, we believe the greater risk is  **demand destruction** —a psychological freeze in corporate confidence that could prove deflationary. This complex macroeconomic framework provides the context for applying the firm's core philosophical tenets to asset selection.

##### 3.0 The Philosophical Framework: Reflexivity and High-Conviction Action

Our investment philosophy dictates how we translate macroeconomic views into actionable portfolio decisions, allowing us to act with decisive conviction when opportunities arise.First, we continue to apply George Soros’s  **Theory of Reflexivity** . This theory posits that a feedback loop exists where investor perception actively shapes, rather than just reflects, market fundamentals. In the current AI cycle, we are not merely passive investors; we are participating in and capitalizing on the manipulative function of this feedback loop. As capital floods into dominant tech firms, their rising stock prices enable them to acquire competitors and fund massive capital expenditures, which in turn improves their fundamental position and validates the initial high valuations. This self-reinforcing cycle allows these firms to effectively "buy the future."Second, these insights are actioned through CIO Dawn Fitzpatrick’s  **"Pound the Table" Doctrine** . This doctrine is built on two core principles: exercising extreme patience during periods of market efficiency and deploying capital with overwhelming aggression when rare, asymmetric opportunities present themselves. This philosophy explains the "step-function" changes evident in the Q3 portfolio. We did not merely rebalance our position in Alphabet (GOOGL); we increased our share count by  **2,341%** . This action represents a declaration of a "pound the table" moment, signaling our conviction that a significant market dislocation had occurred, and the tangible implementation of this philosophy is evident in the portfolio's current barbell architecture.

##### 4.0 Portfolio Architecture: The Barbell Strategy in Action

The "Barbell Strategy" is the practical manifestation of our macro and philosophical views, designed to capture significant upside from our highest-conviction themes while explicitly hedging against the tail risks inherent in our bifurcated economic outlook.

###### *4.1 Offensive Allocation: High-Conviction Quality Compounders*

The offensive engine of the portfolio consists of massive, concerted allocations into a select group of mega-cap technology firms with fortress balance sheets and dominant market positions.

* **Amazon (AMZN):**  Our  **481.5%**  increase in share count is a direct bet on our bifurcated thesis. The Prime membership base, which skews wealthier, insulates the retail business, while Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the essential infrastructure layer for the corporate CapEx arms race in AI.  
* **Alphabet (GOOGL):**  The  **2,341%**  increase in our share count reflects a contrarian bet that the market had overly discounted regulatory and AI-competition risks. This created a significant dislocation between the stock price and the intrinsic value of a premier cash-flow machine possessing the world's most valuable data assets.  
* **Apple (AAPL):**  We increased our position by  **1,555%** , viewing Apple as the ultimate proxy bet on the continued discretionary spending power of the global affluent class, a direct beneficiary of the wealth effect supporting consumption among high-income individuals.

###### *4.2 Defensive Posture: Hedging, Value, and Contrarian Options*

To balance these concentrated growth bets, the other side of the barbell is composed of defensive hedges, opportunistic value plays, and defined-risk contrarian options.

* **Broad Market Hedge:**  Our position in  **SPY Puts** , valued at approximately $125 million, is not merely insurance but a tool for sophisticated risk shaping. This creates a "convex" payout profile—limited downside, unlimited upside—designed to appreciate significantly in a tail-risk event, offsetting losses in our long-equity book.  
* **Opportunistic Value:**  Our new position in  **The Walt Disney Co. (DIS)**  is a direct application of our core philosophy. A negative reflexive cycle of pervasive pessimism has divorced the stock price from the immense intrinsic value of its unique intellectual property and assets, creating a compelling turnaround opportunity.  
* **Defined-Risk Contrarianism:**  We use call options to gain capital-efficient upside exposure to deeply out-of-favor themes. The  **115%**  increase in our  **iShares China Large-Cap ETF (FXI) Calls**  is a limited-risk bet on a potential rebound, with our exposure strictly defined by the premium paid.Executing a strategy of this nature is only possible due to the unique structural advantages inherent in our firm’s composition.

##### 5.0 The Structural Advantage: Exploiting Permanent Capital

SFM’s strategy is enabled by a structural framework unavailable to most market participants. The critical distinction, as articulated by our CIO, is between  **risk** —the permanent impairment of capital—and  **volatility** , which is merely the temporary fluctuation in an asset's mark-to-market price.Our permanent capital base provides a profound competitive advantage by allowing the firm to treat volatility as an opportunity. Unlike hedge funds facing investor redemptions, we are immune to such pressures. This allows us to "lean into dislocations" and act as a buyer from forced sellers, acquiring quality assets at distressed prices. The current high-rate environment has created a unique opportunity set we term  **"Rescue Finance."**  As many operationally sound companies face a "maturity wall" on legacy debt, SFM can act as a liquidity provider, demanding highly favorable terms. Crucially, we use the public markets as an information engine for these private deals; public equities mark-to-market daily, revealing stress that private credit portfolios often hide, allowing us to price risk with superior accuracy.

##### 6.0 Conclusion: A Cohesive Strategy for a Complex Era

The Q3 2025 portfolio, with its extreme concentration in technology, is the deliberate result of a cohesive, multi-layered strategy. Our conviction in a bifurcated economy demanded a barbell portfolio architecture; our "pound the table" philosophy provided the aggression to execute it with overwhelming force when dislocations appeared; and our permanent capital structure furnished the unique stability required to treat volatility as an opportunity rather than a threat. This active, directional posture is not a passive bet on market direction but a framework calibrated to exploit the primary vectors of secular growth while remaining resilient to the environment's significant underlying risks.
