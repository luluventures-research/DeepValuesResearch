## **Latest Quarter Earnings Summary**

The financial results for AppLovin Corporation’s third quarter of 2025, ended September 30, represent a definitive validation of the company's multi-year strategic transition toward an artificial intelligence (AI)-centric software infrastructure model.1 During the period, AppLovin reported revenue of $1.405 billion, representing a substantial 68% year-over-year increase compared to fiscal Q3 2024\.1 This figure comfortably exceeded the consensus analyst estimate of $1.34 billion, reflecting a top-line surprise of approximately 5.2%.5 The growth was primarily attributed to the continued scaling and iterative refinement of the AXON machine-learning engine within the core gaming advertising models, alongside early-stage momentum in non-gaming verticals such as e-commerce.3  
Profitability metrics reached historical highs, underscoring the extreme operational leverage inherent in the company’s algorithmic software platform. Adjusted EBITDA was reported at $1.158 billion, a 79% year-over-year increase, resulting in a record Adjusted EBITDA margin of 82%.1 This margin expansion was driven by the successful divestiture of the lower-margin Apps business and a highly efficient conversion of incremental revenue into profit, with sequential flow-through to Adjusted EBITDA reaching 95%.4 Net income for the quarter reached $836 million, more than doubling from the $434 million reported in the year-ago period, translating to a GAAP profit of $2.45 per share.1  
Liquidity and cash flow performance remained exceptionally strong, supporting aggressive capital allocation initiatives. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1.05 billion, and Free Cash Flow (FCF) likewise reached $1.05 billion for the third quarter of 2025, marking a 92% year-over-year surge.1 The company utilized its robust cash generation to repurchase approximately 1.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a total cost of $571 million.1 Reflecting management's confidence in the terminal value of the platform, the Board of Directors authorized an incremental $3.2 billion increase to the share repurchase program, raising the total remaining authorization to $3.3 billion as of late October 2025\.1  
Management provided optimistic guidance for the fourth quarter of 2025, projecting revenue in the range of $1.57 billion to $1.60 billion, which implies 12% to 14% sequential growth.1 Adjusted EBITDA is anticipated to land between $1.29 billion and $1.32 billion, with targeted margins remaining between 82% and 83%.1 This guidance underscores the scalability of the AXON 2.0 infrastructure, which is now being positioned to scale advertiser accounts without a corresponding reliance on a massive manual sales force, particularly as the self-service platform moves toward broader availability in 2026\.4

## **Business Model**

AppLovin Corporation identifies itself as a leading software-based marketing platform that empowers mobile app developers to enhance the discovery, acquisition, and monetization of their content.11 Since its founding in 2012, the company has evolved from a mobile game publisher into a critical infrastructure provider for the mobile economy, functioning as the "rails" that power billions of mobile interactions daily.13 The defining characteristic of the modern AppLovin business model is its vertical integration, which encompasses supply-side mediation, demand-side bidding, and deep-learning AI optimization.15

### **Main Sources of Income**

AppLovin’s revenue is categorized into two primary segments: the Software Platform and the Apps segment. However, the 2025 fiscal year marked a structural pivot, as the company completed the divestiture of its legacy Apps portfolio to focus exclusively on its high-margin advertising technology.3

1. **Software Platform (Advertising Revenue):** This is the company's growth engine, powered by the AXON machine-learning engine.2 Revenue is derived from fees paid by advertisers to acquire users and from mediation fees. The segment includes AppDiscovery (performance marketing), MAX (in-app bidding), Adjust (analytics), and Wurl (connected TV).16  
2. **Apps (First-Party Content):** Historically, this segment generated revenue through in-app purchases (IAP) and advertising within owned mobile games like *Wordscapes*. Following the sale to Tripledot Studios in mid-2025, this segment’s contribution is transitioning toward a passive equity stake and promissory note payments, effectively making AppLovin a pure-play AdTech firm.8

| Segment | Proportion (2024 FY) | Mechanism | 2025 Strategic Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Advertising Platform | 68.5% | CPI/CPA Fees, Bidding fees | Core Growth Focus |
| Apps Portfolio | 31.5% | IAP, Ad Revenue | Divested/Non-core |

### **Customer and Client Profiles**

AppLovin serves a global, dual-sided marketplace consisting of mobile app developers and advertisers.20

* **B2B Segment (App Developers & Publishers):** This group represents the vast majority of revenue. It ranges from solo indie creators to large enterprise studios like Renren and Jam City.20 These clients utilize MAX and Adjust to optimize their ad yields and track attribution. No single customer accounts for more than 10% of total revenue, indicating low concentration risk.23  
* **B2B Segment (Advertisers):** This group utilizes AppDiscovery to find high-value users. While traditionally dominated by game studios, the fastest-growing sub-segment in 2025 is e-commerce and retail brands seeking Meta-like performance at a lower cost.3  
* **Scale and Reach:** The platform reaches approximately 1.6 billion daily active users (DAUs) and over 5 billion global smartphone users through its integrated SDKs, providing a massive surface area for data collection and ad delivery.16

### **Sales Units and Subscriptions**

In its software segment, AppLovin does not sell traditional units or subscriptions in the consumer sense. Instead, it monetizes through "outcomes".16

* **Performance Units:** Advertisers typically pay on a Cost-Per-Install (CPI) or Cost-Per-Action (CPA) basis. Revenue per installation (RPI) increased 75% in Q3 2025, even as the volume of total installations fluctuated slightly, demonstrating higher monetization efficiency per unit of traffic.8  
* **Software Enterprise Clients (SPEC):** The company tracks high-value business clients who generate over $125,000 in TTM revenue. As of mid-2022, this count exceeded 500 and has scaled significantly alongside the launch of AXON 2.0.27  
* **SaaS Components:** Through the Adjust acquisition, the company earns recurring subscription revenue from mobile measurement and fraud prevention modules.16

### **The Competitive Moat**

AppLovin’s moat is constructed from a self-reinforcing data flywheel and high switching costs.15

* **Data Monopolization:** With a 60%+ market share in mediation via MAX, AppLovin has a "privileged view" of the entire mobile auction ecosystem. This data is fed into AXON, making its predictive models more accurate than those of competitors who lack supply-side visibility.15  
* **Information Asymmetry:** AppLovin acts as both the auctioneer (MAX) and a participant (AppDiscovery). It sees the bids of all other networks before deciding its own demand strategy, a structural advantage that is extremely difficult for peers to replicate.16  
* **Technical Lock-in:** Integrating a mediation SDK into an app’s code base is a non-trivial engineering task. Once a developer is integrated, switching to a competitor like Unity Ads or Google AdMob carries significant risk of downtime and revenue loss, creating a "sticky" customer relationship.17

## **Headwinds & Risks**

The transition to an AI-infrastructure company has introduced new risks even as it has amplified growth. These risks can be categorized into temporary macroeconomic factors and permanent structural shifts.

### **Short-term Headwinds**

Economic and industry factors that could temporarily impact business include:

* **Cyclical Ad Spending:** While performance advertising is more durable than brand advertising, it remains sensitive to the macroeconomic environment. High interest rates and inflation can temporarily compress user acquisition budgets for developers.4  
* **Market Sentiment and Allegations:** The stock is highly sensitive to external scrutiny. In late 2025 and early 2026, the company experienced sharp pullbacks following a report from CapitalWatch alleging that proceeds from "pig butchering" scams and Ponzi schemes were converging inside its ad ecosystem.26 While management maintains these are unfounded, the resulting investigations can temporarily distract leadership and suppress valuation multiples.29  
* **Onboarding Friction:** The launch of the self-service Ads Manager on a referral-only basis indicates that the company is still optimizing its onboarding funnels. Rushing this process could lead to low-quality ad accounts and user experience degradation.4

### **Long-term and Permanent Risks**

Factors that could fundamentally and permanently alter the business’s terminal value include:

* **Platform Policy Changes:** AppLovin’s existence is predicated on access to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store ecosystems. Permanent changes to privacy frameworks (e.g., Apple’s ATT or Google’s Privacy Sandbox) that further restrict user-level tracking would diminish the effectiveness of AXON’s predictive capabilities.2  
* **Regulatory Encroachment:** Expanding data protection laws, particularly the GDPR in the European Union, pose a permanent hurdle. The complexity of GDPR compliance has already led management to deprioritize inventory expansion in the EU for certain non-gaming products.2  
* **The AI Arms Race:** While AXON 2.0 currently provides a superior ROAS, the barrier to entry for AI models is lowering. If competitors like Meta or Google successfully integrate similar real-time optimization tools across the open internet, AppLovin’s current lead in "non-walled-garden" traffic could be permanently eroded.19  
* **SEC Probes:** Ongoing investigations into data collection practices could result in permanent structural changes to how the company ingests and processes user information.2

## **Cost Structure**

The strategic divestiture of the Apps business has profoundly simplified AppLovin’s cost structure, shifting it from a labor-intensive content studio toward a high-margin, automated algorithm business.2

### **Fixed vs. Variable Costs**

AppLovin now benefits from immense operating leverage, meaning its cost base does not grow linearly with its revenue.

* **Variable Costs (Cost of Revenue):** This primarily consists of publisher payouts, which are a direct function of ad spend. It also includes royalties and server costs that scale with the number of ad requests.17  
* **Fixed Costs (Operating Expenses):** These are largely composed of labor and infrastructure. The company maintains a lean employee base of approximately 1,563 to 1,710 personnel.34

### **Cost Components and Trends**

The company emphasizes "cost discipline in every aspect of the business".4

* **Cost Per Unit:** As an algorithm-based business, the "marginal cost" of processing one additional ad request is near zero, although cumulative data center costs increased to $155 million in Q2 2025 to support AXON's growth.25  
* **Labour Expenses:** Personnel costs are concentrated in high-end engineering and AI research. Total stock-based compensation reached $369.4 million in 2024, utilized as a primary tool to align employee interests with long-term performance.37  
* **Advertising & Marketing:** Unlike many tech firms, AppLovin spends conservatively on its own sales and marketing ($48.6 million in Q3 2025\) because its platform acts as its own discovery tool for developers.25

| Cost Category (Q3 2025\) | Amount (USD Thousands) | Trend Analysis |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Cost of Revenue | $174,855 | Declining as proportion of total revenue |
| R\&D Expense | $43,852 | Increasing in absolute terms; technical talent focus |
| S\&M Expense | $48,575 | Conservative; referral-based growth model |
| G\&A Expense | $58,756 | Stable; disciplined administrative scaling |

The most significant costs are publisher payouts (Cost of Revenue) and Technical Labour (R\&D). In different economic conditions, Cost of Revenue automatically scales down with declining ad budgets, while R\&D remains a fixed strategic commitment to maintain AXON’s edge.25

## **Management & Governance**

AppLovin's leadership is characterized by an entrepreneurial "founder mentality" and a deep alignment with institutional private equity through its partnership with KKR.40

### **Current Executive Team and Board**

The leadership team has remained remarkably stable since the company's early bootstrapping days.40

* **Adam Foroughi (CEO, Chairperson, Co-Founder):** At the helm since 2012, Foroughi is the primary architect of the AXON pivot. He is a serial entrepreneur in the AdTech space.41  
* **Matt Stumpf (CFO):** Joined in 2020 to lead the IPO process after a career in M\&A consulting at PwC.42  
* **Vasily Shikin (CTO):** The engineering lead since 2012, responsible for the core technological stack.42  
* **Board of Directors:** Includes Craig Billings (CEO of Wynn Resorts), Herald Chen (former AppLovin President/CFO and KKR executive), and independent directors like Sukhinder Singh Cassidy, Chris DeWolfe (MySpace Co-founder), and Maynard Webb (Webb Investment Network).22  
* **Notable Former Members:** Ted Oberwager (KKR representative) will not stand for re-election in 2025, signaling the typical exit of private equity sponsors post-IPO.43

### **Past Performance and Integrity**

Management has established a strong track record of following through on bold promises. The delivery of the AXON 2.0 engine and the clean launch of the self-service platform on October 1, 2025, are cited as evidence of "execution excellence".4 Management does not appear to hide systemic problems; instead, they have proactively addressed technical onboarding "hiccups" and admitted that their current funnels require further optimization to meet quality standards.4  
When questioned by analysts, leadership tends to strategically defer expansion into complex markets (like the EU) to focus on higher-certainty, English-speaking inventory.4 While short-sellers have questioned the "black box" nature of AXON's data sources, there have been no formal findings of misconduct to date.28

### **Value Alignment and Investment**

The interests of leadership are structurally tethered to share price appreciation.

* **Direct Ownership:** Adam Foroughi owns 10.9% of the company's equity, a stake worth approximately $19.3 billion.45  
* **Compensation vs. Growth:** 96.4% of the CEO's total compensation is non-cash (stock and options), meaning he earns exponentially more from growing the business value than from his base salary.46  
* **Acquisition History:** Management has not been observed acquiring significant blocks of stock during short-term declines in 2025, as their existing holdings are already concentrated. Instead, the company uses the corporate share buyback program as the primary mechanism for opportunistic acquisition.29

## **Shareholders & Capital Returns**

AppLovin maintains a high degree of institutional integration, although voting power remains concentrated in the hands of the founders and original insiders.40

### **Top Shareholders and Voting History**

The company uses a dual-class structure: Class A (1 vote/share) and Class B (20 votes/share).49 Adam Foroughi holds majority voting control via his Class B shares.40

| Holder Name | Class A Ownership % | Portfolio Profile | Recent Action |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Adam Foroughi | 10.9% | Founder/Insider | Primary Voting Control |
| The Vanguard Group | 7.38% | Passive Index | Supported all 2025 management proposals |
| BlackRock, Inc. | 7.38% | Passive Index | Supported all 2025 management proposals |
| Ling Tang | 5.1% | Private Individual | Long-term stakeholder |
| State Street Corp | 3.51% | Passive Index | Increased position 111% in Q3 2025 |

At the June 4, 2025, Shareholder Meeting, stockholders voted on the election of nine directors and the ratification of Deloitte & Touche LLP. Both were approved with overwhelming majorities (over 700 million votes "FOR").49 Institutional stands from Vanguard and BlackRock for the 2024-2025 proxy year indicate a preference for board quality overboarding policies and a more skeptical approach to non-material Environmental & Social (E\&S) proposals.53

### **Share Buyback Plan**

The buyback strategy has transitioned from a standard anti-dilution tool into an aggressive opportunistic weapon for returning capital.47

* **Current Plan:** $3.3 billion total capacity as of late 2025\.1  
* **Mechanics:** Management recently modified the plan to allow for immediate repurchases regardless of the prior quarter's FCF, providing the agility to respond to short-seller-induced price drops.47  
* **Historical Comparison:** In the former 10 years (mostly private), buybacks were non-existent. Since 2022, authorizations have grown from $750M to nearly $8B in total approved cumulative capital returns.57

## **Value Investor Transactions**

Value investors have viewed AppLovin as a "growth-at-a-reasonable-price" play during its 2022-2023 trough, though many have lightened positions as valuations stretched in 2025\.59

| Investor | Avg Reported Price | Recent Activity | Current Holding Status |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Stephen Mandel (Lone Pine) | $69.22 \- $130.55 | Reduced 12.07% (Q3 2025\) | Still holding \~5.8% portfolio weight |
| O. Andreas Halvorsen (Viking) | $718.54 | Reduced 56.42% (Q3 2025\) | 0.3% of portfolio |
| Chase Coleman III (Tiger Global) | $10.53 \- $75.17 | Increased 20.07% (Q2 2025\) | Major holder; 2.06% of portfolio |
| Pat Dorsey (Dorsey Asset) | $130.55 | Sold 100% (Q4 2024\) | Exit |

Stephen Mandel remains a key proponent, having added significantly to the position in early 2024 at prices below $100.59 Conversely, Viking Global Investors exhibited aggressive profit-taking at the 2025 all-time highs.59

## **Conclusions**

AppLovin Corporation represents a structural anomaly in the digital advertising sector. Through the successful operationalization of the AXON deep-learning engine and the strategic divestiture of its gaming assets, the company has transformed into a high-margin algorithm business with sector-leading cash flow conversion.2 The Q3 2025 results confirm a profitability profile that rivals major "walled garden" platforms like Meta, yet at a fraction of the headcount and capital expenditure.2  
From a value investing standpoint, AppLovin’s current valuation (P/E \> 60\) disqualifies it from traditional Graham-style "deep value" baskets.62 However, the company passes most "quality compounder" tests, exhibiting high ROIC, sticky customer relationships, and immense operational leverage.16 The primary risks are exogenous: regulatory pressures in the EU and the potential for platform policy shifts from Apple and Google that could diminish the quality of AXON’s training data.2 For the disciplined investor, the stock currently trades at a premium to its intrinsic valuesituations, suggesting that a significant portion of its AI-driven success is already reflected in the share price.24
