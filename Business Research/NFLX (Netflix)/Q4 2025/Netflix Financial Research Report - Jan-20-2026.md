## **Latest Quarter Earnings Summary**

Netflix’s **Q4 2025** results capped a strong year, exceeding its financial objectives. Quarterly revenue reached **$12.05 billion**, up 18% year-over-year, and paid memberships crossed **325 million** globally . Operating income grew **30%**to **$2.96 billion**, expanding the operating margin to **24.5%** . Diluted EPS rose **31%** to **$0.56** (after a 10-for-1 stock split in Nov 2025\) . Net income was **$2.42 billion** (up 29%) , and free cash flow improved 36% to **$1.87 billion** . For full-year 2025, Netflix delivered **16% revenue growth** to **$45.2 billion** with a **29.5% operating margin** . Advertising emerged as a new growth driver – ad revenue topped **$1.5 billion** in 2025 (2.5× 2024\) and is forecast to double to \~$3 billion in 2026 . Management guided **2026** revenue of \~$51 billion (14% YoY) and a **31.5%** operating margin . They project **free cash flow around $6 billion** in 2026 , reflecting disciplined content spending growth below revenue growth. Netflix also announced an $82.7 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. (including HBO) to accelerate its content moat . The deal, structured as mostly cash, caused short-term concern over leverage, but management plans to rapidly deleverage using its \~$9 billion annual FCF . Overall, Netflix ended 2025 with **$55.6 billion** in assets (including $32.8 billion content library) and **$5.5 billion** net debt . It paused share buybacks (after repurchasing $2.1 billion in Q4) to preserve cash for the Warner acquisition .

## **Business Model**

**How Netflix Makes Money:** Netflix operates a subscription-based streaming service offering unlimited video content on-demand globally. Its **primary revenue** comes from monthly membership fees. In 2024, streaming subscriptions contributed virtually all of its $39 billion revenue . Netflix recently added an advertising-supported tier, generating over **$1.5 billion** (\~3% of 2025 revenue) and expected to double in 2026 . Other income sources (e.g. content licensing, merchandise, DVD rentals) are minimal or discontinued (the legacy DVD-by-mail service closed in 2023). The chart below shows Netflix’s revenue composition, dominated by streaming subscriptions (≈97%) with a small but growing ad revenue slice.

Netflix’s **customer base** is massive and still growing. By Q4 2025 it had **325 million paid memberships** worldwide , up from 302 million a year earlier . This makes Netflix the world’s largest streaming platform. These memberships are shared across households, reaching an estimated audience of nearly **1 billion people** globally . Netflix added over 23 million net new subscribers in 2025, rebounding from slower growth in 2022\. Each member pays an average monthly fee ($8–$11 globally), which Netflix has periodically raised as it adds content and value.

**Sales Volume:** Netflix sells access to its content library as a service rather than discrete units. It “sells” **subscriptions** – essentially one product with tiers (Basic with ads, Standard, Premium). In 2025, Netflix sold about **325 million subscription units**, measured as paying members. This was up from \~221 million in 2021 and \~110 million in 2017, reflecting rapid growth . Engagement is high: members streamed 1.33 trillion hours in 2025 (an average of 4+ hours per day per membership) according to the shareholder letter. Netflix does not sell individual films or episodes; the subscription bundles unlimited streaming.

**Economic Moat:** Netflix has built a formidable competitive moat primarily through its **scale and content ecosystem**. With the world’s largest paying subscriber base and a global brand, Netflix enjoys significant network effects – content creators seek it for distribution and consumers default to it for entertainment. Its **content library** – now boosted by the Warner Bros. acquisition – is unparalleled. Netflix spent over $17 billion on content in 2025 alone (including originals in local languages) and now controls iconic franchises like *Harry Potter* and *Game of Thrones* via WarnerMedia . This deep library is a durable asset that new entrants struggle to replicate . Netflix’s recommendation algorithm and user data also enhance its moat by personalizing content to viewer tastes (driving engagement and reducing churn). Moreover, the company’s global distribution infrastructure (with apps on virtually every device and smart TV) gives it unmatched **reach**– under 10% of TV viewing time even now, leaving room to grow . Finally, Netflix’s brand (over 230 countries, synonymous with streaming) provides significant mindshare. In short, Netflix’s **scale, brand, technology, and content IP**create a self-reinforcing moat that competitors (like Disney+, Amazon Prime, etc.) have found expensive to challenge. Netflix’s recent moves (password sharing crackdown and ad-tier) further entrench its competitive position by monetizing more users and attracting price-sensitive segments.

*Figure: Netflix’s Massive Content Library Secures Its Moat.* In late 2025, Netflix agreed to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and HBO assets for $82.7 billion, instantly adding **100+ years of content IP** (e.g. DC Comics films, *Harry Potter*, *Friends*) to its library . Analysts noted this “**unassailable defensive moat**” – Netflix will own the **most prestigious content library** in media, making its service indispensable . Combined with Netflix’s strong original franchises (*Stranger Things*, *Squid Game*), this creates a content portfolio competitors will *“struggle to replicate”* .

## **Headwinds & Risks**

**Short-Term Headwinds:** Netflix faces several near-term challenges that could temporarily impact performance. First, **macroeconomic factors** like a strong US dollar have weighed on reported revenue – Netflix noted 2025 revenue growth would have been 1–2 percentage points higher constant-currency . In certain emerging markets, high inflation and weaker local currencies may curb consumer spending on subscriptions or force Netflix to adjust pricing. Second, **production disruptions** can create content gaps; for example, the 2023 Hollywood writers’ and actors’ strikes delayed some 2024 releases, potentially affecting subscriber growth and engagement in the short run. Third, **competition intensity** remains high: rivals such as Disney+, Amazon Prime, and HBO Max (which Netflix is now acquiring) continue to fight for content and subscribers, driving up content costs and marketing noise. While Netflix’s subscriber base is still growing, quarterly net adds can be volatile if a competitor launches a viral hit or exclusive sports content. Fourth, **geopolitical and regulatory issues** present headwinds – e.g., Netflix had to suspend service in Russia in 2022 due to sanctions, and privacy or censorship regulations in markets like the EU, India or China (where Netflix is not present) can constrain growth. Finally, **password sharing** crackdowns, which Netflix implemented globally in 2023, carry execution risk: while intended to boost memberships, they risk some user backlash or cancellations in the short term. Indeed, Netflix saw an initial uptick in churn when it began charging for extra users, before net new sign-ups accelerated later in 2023\. Such **subscriber sentiment fluctuations** are a short-term risk.

**Long-Term/Permanent Risks:** Over the long run, Netflix must navigate structural challenges that could permanently alter its trajectory. A key risk is **market saturation** – Netflix now reaches over 80% of broadband households in North America and high penetration in Europe. Future growth relies on expanding in lower-ARPU regions (Asia, Africa) and new demographics. Slowing membership growth (e.g. virtually flat US/Canada subs in 2022\) hints at saturation in core markets. If global subscriber growth plateaus, Netflix will depend on price increases or per-member revenue (like ads) for growth, which has limits. Another enduring risk is **content cost escalation**. To stay ahead, Netflix invests heavily in content (\~$17 billion cash spend 2025\) and now will shoulder WarnerMedia’s library and production costs . Competing bidders (Amazon, Apple) with deep pockets could continue driving up costs for premium content (e.g. sports rights, top talent), pressuring Netflix’s margins long-term. Additionally, **changing consumer behavior** poses a risk – the streaming market is maturing and consumers may grow weary of multiple subscriptions (“subscription fatigue”). If cheaper or ad-supported alternatives (e.g. TikTok, YouTube, free streaming channels) steal significant viewing time, Netflix could face higher churn or slower acquisition, a structural headwind.

Regulatory and political factors also loom as potential permanent impacts. Many countries have begun enforcing local content quotas or data residency laws. The EU, for instance, requires streaming platforms to host 30% European content – compliance adds cost. Governments from Turkey to Vietnam have at times pressured Netflix over content censorship or taxation of digital services, which could limit Netflix’s uniform global model. In extreme cases, **antitrust** scrutiny could arise if regulators deem Netflix’s market position (especially post-Warner acquisition) as too dominant in entertainment. However, Netflix has so far avoided serious antitrust issues by pointing to broader competition in entertainment.

Finally, Netflix’s strategy to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio for $82.7 billion in late 2025 introduces **financial leverage risk**. The deal adds around $50 billion debt , reversing Netflix’s recent deleveraging. While management plans rapid paydown, a permanent risk is if interest rates rise or a recession hits, Netflix could be **burdened by high debt service**. A heavily-leveraged balance sheet may constrain content spending flexibility in downturns, potentially eroding its competitive edge. In summary, **market saturation, content economics, shifting consumer habits, regulatory pressures, and debt** constitute the key long-term risks that could fundamentally impact Netflix’s business model if not adeptly managed.

## **Cost Structure**

Netflix’s costs consist of two main buckets: **cost of revenue** (content and delivery) which is largely fixed in the short term, and operating expenses (marketing, tech, G\&A) which have variable components.

* **Cost per Unit (Content Costs):** Netflix’s primary “unit” cost is the content cost per subscription. This is dominated by **amortized content investments** – the company spends cash upfront to license or produce shows, and then amortizes those costs over the content’s useful life. In 2024, Netflix’s cost of revenues was **$21.0 billion**, about 54% of revenue . This included \~$17–18 billion of content amortization. On a per-member basis, Netflix’s content spend equated to roughly $52 per subscriber annually. Notably, adding an extra subscriber has minimal immediate cost – content amortization is **fixed** regardless of viewership, and streaming delivery for one member costs only a few dollars per year. Thus, the marginal cost per new subscriber is very low, giving Netflix significant scale economies. However, to maintain engagement, Netflix must continually invest in new content; one could view the *maintenance content cost* per subscriber as the portion of spend needed each year to keep the library fresh. In 2025, with 325 million members and $17 billion content amortization, that’s about **$52** per sub – broadly Netflix’s annual cost to provide content service to one subscriber.  
* **Labor Expenses:** Netflix employs \~12,800 full-time employees (2022) across content production, engineering, marketing, and administration . Its **salary and payroll costs** are embedded in both cost of revenue (e.g. producer salaries) and operating expenses (corporate staff). For 2024, Netflix’s total personnel expense was estimated around $1.3 billion (based on average compensation and headcount). Labor is a relatively small portion of total costs (\~3% of revenue) because Netflix outsources most content production to external studios or independent creators (paid via content budgets). However, talent costs are rising industry-wide – top producers and executives receive generous stock options. Netflix’s unique culture of hiring “fully formed adults” at high pay means it doesn’t skimp on salaries. The company has also expanded its tech workforce for gaming and advertising initiatives. While labor is not Netflix’s largest cost, it is **semi-variable** – management can slow hiring or do selective layoffs (as seen with \~450 job cuts in 2022\) when growth slows, but they must retain creative and technical talent. Importantly, Netflix’s stock-based compensation (especially for executives) is significant; e.g. co-CEO Ted Sarandos earned $40 million in 2022 mostly in stock. Overall, labor costs tend to grow with revenue but more slowly than content spend, giving some operating leverage.  
* **Advertising & Marketing:** Marketing is Netflix’s largest variable operating expense. In its growth phase (2015–2019), Netflix spent heavily on advertising to acquire subscribers – e.g. **$2.65 billion** in 2019 (13% of revenue). This has since moderated: 2024 marketing expense was \~$2.5 billion, just **6.4% of revenue** . Netflix’s marketing includes online ads, billboards, and content promotion trailers, aimed at both acquiring new members and driving viewing of new releases. The company has achieved more organic growth lately via word-of-mouth hits (e.g. *Squid Game*), allowing it to scale back paid marketing as a percentage of sales. For example, marketing fell from 12% of revenue in 2020 to under 7% in 2024 as subscriber growth became more self-sustaining. That said, marketing costs can spike when Netflix enters new markets or launches major content – in 2021, Netflix boosted marketing around big film releases and saw expense rise 33% to $2.55 billion. Marketing is a **controllable lever**: in economic downturns, Netflix can trim ad spend to protect margins (assuming subscriber growth can rely more on its content brand). We saw this in 2022 when marketing spend grew only \~5% despite revenue up 6.5%, helping support a 19% operating margin .  
* **Major Cost Components & Trends:** By far Netflix’s most significant cost is content. Content amortization accounted for \~80–85% of cost of revenues in recent years (with the remainder being content delivery and customer support). On a cash basis, content spend peaked at \~$17 billion in 2021 and 2022, then was held roughly flat as Netflix prioritized positive free cash flow . This discipline, plus slower sub growth, means **content costs are growing slower** (mid-single-digits) than before, improving margins. Other cost lines like technology & development (\~5% of revenue) and G\&A (\~3%) are relatively small. Notably, **streaming delivery** costs (bandwidth agreements, cloud services) are variable with usage but benefit from scale – Netflix’s delivery cost per hour streamed has declined with traffic optimization. For example, in 2021, despite increased viewing, delivery expense rose only \~2%. This efficiency stems from Netflix’s Open Connect CDN network and partnerships with ISPs. **Which costs are most significant?** Content amortization is by far the largest, comprising about 45% of revenue in 2024\. The next biggest is marketing at \~6%, followed by tech/dev \~5%. These three make up the bulk of expenses, whereas G\&A (\~2%) and other costs are relatively minor.

**Fixed vs Variable Cost Behavior:** Netflix’s cost structure has high fixed components (content, infrastructure) and low marginal cost per user, giving it operating leverage. Content production is largely a fixed upfront investment – once a show is made, the cost is sunk and serving additional subscribers or additional viewing hours has negligible cost. This is why Netflix’s **gross margin** has risen from \~34% in 2016 to \~46% in 2024 as its subscriber base grew . The fixed content costs are spread over more members, lowering per-unit cost. Conversely, certain costs are more variable: marketing can be scaled up or down each quarter depending on growth targets; content cash spend can be adjusted annually (e.g. Netflix trimmed content budget growth during the pandemic and after subscriber losses in early 2022). In recessionary conditions, Netflix can cut marketing and slow content growth to protect profitability and cash flow – indeed during 2020’s pandemic uncertainty, Netflix’s cash content spend dropped slightly, yielding \+$1.9 billion free cash flow . In boom times, it can invest more aggressively. **Economic conditions effect:** In a strong economy, Netflix may increase content and marketing spend to fuel growth, confident that subscribers will continue paying (and even accept price hikes). In a weak economy, management tends to become cost-conscious – as seen in 2022, when faced with subscriber stagnation, Netflix laid off staff and cut back expense growth . Another factor is interest rates: higher rates raise the cost of debt, which Netflix now has more of post-Warner acquisition. This could permanently increase interest expense (a semi-fixed cost), albeit Netflix plans to rapidly pay down acquisition debt by 2028 to mitigate that.

In summary, **content amortization (fixed)** and **marketing (variable)** are Netflix’s key costs. Content is significant but scale gives Netflix the ability to grow profitably, as evidenced by its rising margins. Keeping content spend growing slower than revenue (as management plans) will be crucial to continue margin expansion in varying economic climates.

## **Management & Governance**

**Leadership Team:** Netflix’s leadership blends the founding vision with seasoned executives. **Reed Hastings**, Netflix’s co-founder, was CEO from 1997 until stepping down to Executive Chairman in January 2023\. Hastings is the architect of Netflix’s culture and long-term strategy. He remains on the board and closely involved in major decisions. The company is now led by co-CEOs **Ted Sarandos** and **Greg Peters** . Ted Sarandos (Netflix veteran since 2000\) oversees all content operations and was pivotal in building Netflix’s originals strategy. Greg Peters (formerly COO) leads product and global business; he spearheaded initiatives like advertising and gaming. Both were elevated to co-CEO in 2023, signaling a continuity of Netflix’s dual focus on content (Sarandos) and technology/business (Peters). **Spencer Neumann**, CFO since 2019, manages finances – he is known for instilling fiscal discipline (he joined from Activision Blizzard). Other key executives include **Bela Bajaria** (Chief Content Officer, overseeing TV/film creative teams) and **Scott Stuber** (Head of Global Films). On the Board of Directors, besides Reed Hastings as Chairman, there’s **Jay Hoag** (venture capitalist and early investor, on board since 1999\) , **Rich Barton** (co-founder of Zillow, an independent director), and various industry veterans and technologists like Anne Sweeney (former Disney executive) and Brad Smith (President of Microsoft). The board has a majority of independent directors and oversees Netflix’s governance and strategic decisions. Historically, Netflix’s management was very stable – many top leaders (Hastings, Sarandos, Hoag) have been with the company for decades, providing continuity.

**Past Performance & Governance Practices:** Netflix’s management is generally regarded as **execution-focused and candid**, though not without missteps. On delivering promises, Hastings-led management had a strong record until 2022 – consistently hitting subscriber and financial targets. When Netflix missed its Q1 2022 subscriber forecast (losing subs for the first time in a decade), management responded decisively: accelerating a pivot to advertising and stricter account sharing rules. They have largely followed through on strategic goals like improving operating margin (from 4% in 2016 to 25%+ by 2024\) , and achieving positive free cash flow by 2022 . Analysts often praise management’s transparency in the investor letter, although Netflix was sometimes criticized for a lack of traditional metrics (e.g. they stopped providing subscriber guidance in 2022 due to volatility). There is little evidence that Netflix’s management hides problems – in fact, when growth stalled in early 2022, Hastings openly acknowledged issues (competition, password sharing) and outlined corrective plans. However, Netflix historically provided less granular disclosure (for instance, they only selectively share viewership data, and until recently they did not do live Q\&A calls). In mid-2022, under investor pressure, Netflix began holding **earnings calls with analysts** to answer questions more directly, improving transparency.

On handling tough questions, Netflix’s top team is generally frank but positive. For example, co-CEO Peters admitted initial password crackdowns caused “churn to tick up” before stabilizing , showing willingness to address short-term pain. The management’s credibility took a small hit after the sudden subscriber decline in 2022 (which they had not anticipated) – the stock plummeted and some investors felt Netflix was late to recognize market saturation. But since then, management regained trust by quickly implementing an ad tier (live in 2022, earlier than many expected) and re-accelerating growth.

Most of Netflix’s senior team have long tenures, contributing to a consistent culture. Reed Hastings, 25+ years; Ted Sarandos, 23 years; the next layer (Bajaria, Peters) each over a decade. This stability has been beneficial, but also means the team hadn’t faced major crisis until 2022\. They navigated that well, which speaks to adaptability.

**Integrity and Shareholder Alignment:** There haven’t been major scandals around Netflix’s management integrity. The company is known for candid, if sometimes blunt, internal culture (“Netflix Culture” deck is famous). One governance concern shareholders raised was the board’s structure – Netflix long had a classified board and supermajority voting requirements. Shareholders pushed for more democracy: in 2022, an *87%* vote approved moving to simple majority voting in charter changes , reflecting investor desire for accountability. Additionally, at the 2022 annual meeting, **60.4% of shareholders approved a proposal** for enhanced lobbying disclosure , against management’s initial recommendation. This indicates large investors sometimes oppose management on governance matters, but Netflix has been responsive – they implemented annual director elections and published transparency reports after those votes.

A notable event: In 2021, nearly **49%** of shares voted against management’s executive compensation plan , and one director (former Expedia CEO Rich Barton) received 72% against votes , signaling investor dissatisfaction with pay and governance. Netflix subsequently made changes, like removing anti-takeover provisions and better tying pay to performance. These instances show that while management can be headstrong, they do eventually heed shareholder concerns.

**Value Alignment (Skin in the Game):** Netflix’s top executives are significantly invested in the company’s success. Co-founder Reed Hastings is the largest individual shareholder, owning \~4.23 million shares as of April 2025 (post-split \~42.3 million shares, 1% of the company). At current prices ($87 post-split), Hastings’ stake is worth \~$3.7 billion – a substantial portion of his wealth, aligning his interests with shareholders. Other insiders hold smaller stakes: Ted Sarandos owned \~557,000 shares (pre-split) , now \~5.57 million shares post-split, worth \~$485 million. Director Jay Hoag held \~380,232 shares (\~3.8 million post-split, \~$330 million value). Many top execs routinely sell some stock (as part of compensation plans), but they retain large positions. For example, in late 2021 Hastings sold some shares for diversification but still held the majority of his stake.

Management’s compensation heavily uses stock options that vest over time, motivating them to increase Netflix’s stock price long-term. In fact, their wealth will grow far more from stock appreciation than from salaries. For instance, Hastings’ annual salary was only $650,000 in 2022, but he has billions in stock. Co-CEO Peters chose to receive **100% of his 2023 compensation in stock options** rather than cash (as disclosed in the proxy), signaling confidence that growing Netflix will be more rewarding than a paycheck. Likewise, many employees can choose cash vs stock; Netflix’s culture encourages equity ownership.

Do insiders buy on dips? There’s limited evidence of big open-market insider buys during declines. When Netflix stock plunged \~75% in early 2022, insiders did not publicly disclose significant purchases – likely because they are already heavily vested via stock grants. However, they also did not abandon ship: no senior executives resigned or drastically cut exposure; instead, they doubled down on strategy (Hastings even quipped that Netflix stock was a bargain when Bill Ackman bought in early 2022). The lack of panic selling from insiders suggests belief in the company’s fundamentals. In short, Netflix’s management and board are **highly aligned with shareholders’ interests** through substantial stock ownership, and they stand to gain far more if the business grows than from their cash compensation. This alignment, combined with generally shareholder-friendly moves (e.g. starting share buybacks in 2021, improving governance), gives investors some confidence in the team’s integrity and commitment to long-term value creation.

## **Shareholders & Capital Returns**

**Ownership Structure:** Netflix’s shareholder base is dominated by large institutional investors, alongside insider holdings by founders and executives. The top three shareholders are **The Vanguard Group** (\~11.1% of shares), **BlackRock, Inc.**(\~10.0%), and **FMR (Fidelity)** (\~6.1%) . Together these institutions own over 27% of Netflix, reflecting the heavy index-fund presence (Netflix is in the S\&P 500). For example, Vanguard and BlackRock each hold \~385 million and 347 million shares respectively (post-split) across their index funds . Among individual insiders, co-founder Reed Hastings is the largest, with \~4.23 million shares as of late 2025 (about 1% of the company). Former CEO/CPO Ted Sarandos holds \~0.1% (after selling some over years) . Long-time director Jay Hoag has a roughly 0.01% stake . No other insider owns above 0.1%. Therefore, Netflix has a **widely held** ownership – no single entity controls it.

**Shareholder Voting & Activism:** Given the dispersed ownership, Netflix’s big investors like Vanguard and BlackRock typically vote in line with governance best practices. In recent years, they have **asserted their votes on key proposals**. Notably, at the 2022 annual meeting, shareholders passed a proposal to eliminate the supermajority vote standard – it received 58% of votes (despite needing 67% to enact) , after winning even higher support (\~90%) in prior years . This persistent near-unanimous voting by top holders eventually pressured Netflix to remove the supermajority requirement in 2023, simplifying voting to majority. Similarly, in 2022, a shareholder proposal on **political lobbying disclosure** – led by Boston Common Asset Management – passed with **60.4% support** . Large investors like BlackRock and State Street, who emphasize ESG transparency, likely voted *for* this proposal, overriding management’s opposition. As a result, Netflix committed to publish reports on its lobbying and political contributions going forward.

Overall, the top institutional shareholders have been **engaged but not activist**. They haven’t sought board seats or radical changes, as Netflix’s performance has been strong. However, they use their votes to push for governance improvements (e.g. annual elections, reporting on diversity). For example, in 2021 nearly half of shares voted against re-electing certain directors and the executive pay package , reflecting displeasure with perhaps the lack of diversity or high compensation. In response, Netflix added new diverse directors and restructured pay. Thus, while no activist investor campaigns have targeted Netflix (its high valuation and founder control deterred activists historically), the **index funds exert quiet influence** by supporting shareholder-friendly proposals.

**Key Shareholder Topics:** At recent shareholder meetings, recurring topics include executive compensation, board governance, and social responsibility. In 2023, shareholders voted on proposals like requiring an annual report on **board diversity and inclusion** (which got \~30% support) and on linking executive pay to ESG metrics (did not pass). The big funds (Vanguard, BlackRock) generally supported the majority vote and lobbying proposals. They likely also push for separation of Chair/CEO roles – something Netflix effectively did when Hastings relinquished the CEO title (he remains Chair, but the CEO role is split between Sarandos and Peters). **Capital allocation** has also become a focus: some shareholders wanted Netflix to return cash via buybacks rather than big acquisitions. Yet, when Netflix announced the Warner Bros. deal in Dec 2025, the stock dipped \~3%, indicating mixed feelings; investors like Capital Group and Wellington (Netflix holders) publicly stated support for the long-term logic of the deal, but also expect disciplined integration and debt reduction.

In summary, Netflix’s major shareholders have executed their voting rights to gradually improve Netflix’s governance (eliminating entrenchment provisions, increasing transparency). Each of the top holders (Vanguard, BlackRock, Fidelity) tends to vote per their proxy guidelines – e.g. they favor one-share-one-vote and annual director elections, which they achieved at Netflix. They also supported Netflix management on routine items (like board elections in 2023 passed easily after changes). **No large shareholder has opposed the Warner acquisition** so far; mutual funds like Fidelity have indicated they believe Netflix’s management has earned some leeway for big strategic moves given past success. In sum, the ownership base is supportive but vigilant on governance, and they have shown willingness to assert their stance via proxy votes on key topics.

**Table Highlights:** Over the past decade, Netflix’s revenue grew at a **28% CAGR** (from $6.8B to $39B). Subscriber growth (from \~70M to \~270M) drove most of this expansion, along with periodic price increases. Profitability improved markedly: net margin rose from under 2% to over 22%, as operating margins expanded five-fold (from 4% in 2015 to 25.5% in 2024\) . This reflects scale economies in content and a moderating cost growth. After years of negative free cash flow (peaking at \-$3.14B in 2019 as Netflix invested heavily in content), Netflix turned FCF-positive in 2020 and by 2023 generated **$6.93B** in FCF (20.5% margin). Netflix’s balance sheet strengthened until 2022 – debt-to-equity fell from \~2.0× in 2018 to \~0.7× in 2022 as earnings grew and debt issuance paused. However, with the late-2025 Warner acquisition adding significant debt, leverage is expected to temporarily rise (pro-forma debt/equity \> 1.5× in 2026\) before the planned paydown. Returns on equity and invested capital have soared – ROE averaged \~25%+ in recent years, demonstrating Netflix’s ability to earn high returns on its retained earnings as growth slows. Notably, **return on invested capital** was \~20% in 2024 , well above Netflix’s cost of capital (\~8–10%), indicating value creation. Liquidity improved too: current ratio climbed above 1.2× by 2024 as cash reserves were built , though it will dip after the Warner deal cash outlay.

Major events reflected in the metrics include the **2017–2019 cash burn** (negative FCF each year) as Netflix aggressively funded original content and international expansion (e.g. launching in 130 countries in 2016). By contrast, **2020** shows a one-time boost: revenue jumped in the pandemic and content cash spend was delayed, yielding \+$1.9B FCF and net margin \>11%. In **2022**, growth stalled (revenue \+6.5%, subscribers slightly down mid-year), prompting cost discipline – hence operating margin remained healthy at 16.7% . Then **2023–2024** illustrate re-acceleration: password sharing fees and the new ad tier helped revenue re-accelerate to \~16% in 2024 with expanding margins and record cash flow. These metrics underscore Netflix’s transformation from a break-even growth story into a highly profitable, cash-generative media leader.

## **Buffett‑Style Checklist**

Warren Buffett’s investment criteria can be applied to evaluate whether Netflix exhibits qualities of a “great company at a fair price.” Below we assess Netflix against key **value investing standards**:

**1\. Valuation Discipline:**

* **P/E ≤ 15:** *Fail.* Netflix has historically traded at high earnings multiples due to growth expectations. Over the past decade, Netflix’s year-end P/E ranged from \~29 to over 400 . Even after the 2022 correction, its P/E was \~29×, and it ended 2024 at **44× earnings** . This is well above the ≤15 benchmark and also above Netflix’s own 10-year average (\~100+). Only briefly in early 2022 did Netflix’s forward P/E dip into the low-20s after the stock collapse, still higher than 15\. Thus, by traditional value standards, Netflix’s earnings multiple is too expensive.  
* **PEG Ratio \< 1:** *Mixed.* Netflix’s **PEG ratio** (P/E divided by earnings growth rate) has fluctuated. During high-growth periods, PEG was favorable: e.g. end of 2017, P/E \~149 and EPS growth \~+200%, PEG ≈ **0.75** (good) . Similarly, in 2021, P/E \~52 and EPS \+84%, PEG \~0.62 (excellent). However, at slower growth points, PEG exceeded 1: end of 2019, P/E \~76, EPS \+54%, PEG \~1.4 (too high); end of 2023, P/E \~40, EPS \+20%, PEG \~2.0 . Over 10 years, Netflix’s PEG averaged \~1.2–1.5 (due to periods of slower earnings growth in 2019 and 2022). As of Jan 2026, with P/E \~35.6 and forward growth \~15%, PEG ≈ 2.4 – failing the \<1 rule. Netflix met this criterion only during its fastest growth spurts; at current moderate growth, it does not.  
* **P/B ≤ 1.5:** *Fail.* Netflix’s **Price-to-Book ratio** has consistently been far above 1.5. Throughout 2015–2021, P/B ranged from \~17× up to 23× . Even after Netflix’s market cap drop in 2022, P/B bottomed around **6.3×** – still 4× higher than 1.5. At end of 2024, P/B was \~15.7× , reflecting Netflix’s high market valuation relative to its accounting equity. This partly stems from the nature of Netflix’s assets: much of its value comes from intangible content and subscriber relationships not fully captured on the balance sheet (content library is on the books, but its true worth can exceed amortized cost). Regardless, by strict P/B metrics, Netflix fails – it has never traded anywhere close to 1.5× book in the past decade. Its lowest P/B (\~6× in mid-2022) was still too high for classic value thresholds.  
* **Margin of Safety – Pay ≥25% below intrinsic value:** *Arguably Fail.* Estimating Netflix’s intrinsic value involves growth assumptions, but most analyses in late 2025 suggest the stock (around $88, or $370B market cap) is not at a 25% discount. A **no-growth DCF** (zero FCF growth) using Netflix’s \~$9.5B 2025 free cash flow at a 10% discount yields \~$95B value – far below the market cap (implying the market is pricing substantial growth). Even a more optimistic DCF with moderate growth (e.g. FCF growing \~6% annually) might put fair value around $250B (roughly $60/share) – still \~30% below the trading price. For a 25% margin of safety, we’d need Netflix stock in the \~$45–$50 range. It hasn’t traded that low (post-split) – the 2022 trough was \~$162 pre-split ($16.20 post), which is \~$162B market cap, and even that may not have been a full 25% MOS given uncertain growth. Thus, **Netflix does not meet the deep value margin of safety criteria**. Its stock has generally priced in strong future growth with little safety cushion, except perhaps briefly in spring 2022 (when some value-minded investors like Bill Ackman took a swing, only to exit quickly) .

**2\. Cash Generation & Allocation:**

* **Positive Free Cash Flow each year & FCF/Revenue \> 5%:** *Fail (historically), Pass (recently).* For years, Netflix had negative free cash flow as it aggressively reinvested in content. From 2013 through 2019, FCF was consistently negative, totaling **\-$10.5 billion outflow** over 2015–2019 . This fails the “positive each year” test. However, the trend reversed: Netflix became FCF-positive in 2020 (+$1.9B) and by 2023 had **$6.93B FCF**, which was 20.5% of revenue – far above the \>5% criterion. For full-year 2024, FCF was \~$6.92B (17.8% margin). So in the most recent 3 years, Netflix passes easily on FCF margin and consistency. But over 10 years, it has only 4 years of positive FCF (2020–2023). The question is whether past negative FCF disqualifies it, or if one considers the forward-looking ability. Given Buffett’s preference is consistent cash generators, Netflix’s past would be a strike. Yet today Netflix is a cash machine with management projecting \~$9B FCF in 2025 . In sum: it **failed historically** but is now meeting this standard (\>5% of revenue and positive).  
* **Return on Retained Earnings ≥ 12%:** *Pass.* This metric examines how effectively the company turns retained profits into additional earnings. Since Netflix paid no dividends and until recently did minimal buybacks, essentially all its earnings have been retained and reinvested. We calculate the “return” by the increase in EPS versus cumulative earnings retained. Over 2013–2023, Netflix’s EPS rose from $0.26 (2013, split-adjusted) to $1.22 (2023), a gain of $0.96. The total EPS retained (sum of EPS each year without payouts) was about $4.94 . So return on retained earnings ≈ 19.4% ($0.96/$4.94). Another approach: in 2012, Netflix’s equity was $1.85B; by 2022, it was $20.8B (no new equity issued, so increase \~$19B from retained earnings) . Over the same period, annual net income grew by $4.2B (from $0.17B in 2012 to $4.49B in 2022). Roughly, each dollar of retained earnings generated \~$0.22 of additional annual profit ($4.32B / $19B), i.e. \~22% return – well above 12%. This suggests Netflix has **reinvested earnings very effectively** (mostly into content that attracted new subscribers). Indeed, Buffett’s test would consider Netflix a company that took retained earnings and generated high market value – Netflix’s market cap grew exponentially from \~$4B in 2012 to \~$370B in 2024, validating high returns on reinvested capital. So Netflix *passes* this criterion by a healthy margin. Importantly, as growth slows, Netflix has signaled it will return more cash (e.g. via buybacks) rather than accumulate excess cash – which aligns with maximizing returns on retained earnings by not retaining more than it can profitably use.

**3\. Growth & Predictability:**

* **EPS positive & rising every year for 10 years:** *Fail.* Netflix’s EPS growth has been strong overall (10-year CAGR \~35%), but it *did not rise every single year*. EPS was positive throughout (Netflix last posted a GAAP loss in 2012), so the positive criterion is met. However, EPS dipped in at least one year: e.g. 2015 EPS was only $0.06 (split-adjusted) vs $0.16 in 2014 , a decline due to heavy international expansion costs. More recently, EPS fell in 2022 ($1.01) from 2021 ($1.15) , due to slower revenue and currency effects. Thus, Netflix fails the *every year increase* rule. It had a streak from 2016–2021 of rising EPS, but the streak broke in 2022 (EPS down \~12%). The unpredictability in EPS (owing to big content amortization and marketing swings) means it’s not a smooth upward trend that Buffett prefers.  
* **Book Value per Share 10-year CAGR ≥ 10%, no year of decline:** *Pass (growth), Fail (decline in one year).*Netflix’s book value per share grew from \~$0.50 in 2014 to \~$5.79 in 2024 – a \~26% CAGR, easily above 10%. This was driven by retained earnings and share count stability. However, there was a slight dip in book value per share from 2021 to 2022: BV/share was $4.67 in 2022 vs $4.73 in 2021 (a 1.3% dip), due to share buybacks and a small FX hit to equity . Aside from that minor decline, book value/share rose each year. Many value investors might overlook a 1% decline given the long-term growth is intact. Overall, Netflix’s equity growth record is excellent (equity grew from $2.2B in 2015 to $24.7B in 2024\) , but strictly, the single down-year breaks the “no contraction” rule. It’s a borderline case; the decline was due to capital return (buybacks \~$600M in 2021–22) and comprehensive loss, not an operating loss. Adjusting for buybacks, tangible book per share still grew. If one is strict: *fail due to 2022*. If one is flexible: Netflix nearly passes this criterion given \~40% annual BVPS growth over 10 years.  
* **Owner’s Earnings positive each year, OE/Market Cap ≥ 10%:** *Fail.* “Owner’s earnings” (net income \+ depreciation \- maintenance capex) for Netflix were negative in many years due to huge content investments. Buffett would likely equate Netflix’s owner earnings to its free cash flow (since content spend is akin to capex). As noted, FCF was negative most of the decade, so owner’s earnings were not consistently positive. Even now, Netflix’s owner earnings (essentially its FCF plus some adjustments) is positive but still only **\~2% of its market cap** in 2024 (FCF \~$6.9B vs market cap $388B) – **far below 10%**. At the worst in 2019, owner’s earnings were deeply negative (–$3B). So Netflix fails the stringent owner’s earnings tests. Only in 2022–2023 did owner earnings turn positive, and even then, the yield (FCF yield) was around 3–4%. This is improving (FCF yield might reach \~5% in 2025 at $9B FCF on a lower post-drop market cap \~$300B), but it’s still under 10%. Buffett-style investors seeking a \>10% “owner earnings yield” would consider Netflix too expensive for its cash generation.

**4\. Balance-Sheet Safety:**

* **Debt-to-Equity \< 0.5:** *Fail (past), Pass (2022-24), likely Fail (post-deal).* For many years, Netflix carried high leverage as it borrowed to fund content. From 2015–2019, D/E climbed from \~1.1× to \~1.9×. It improved to 0.97× by 2021 (debt $15.4B, equity $15.8B) and \~0.70× in 2022 , which finally *passes* \<0.5 if one excludes content liabilities. However, including content liabilities (which behave like debt), leverage was higher. At end of 2024, D/E was 0.56× (debt $13.8B, equity $24.7B) – still above 0.5, though close. The big caveat: Netflix is taking on \~$50B new debt for Warner Bros . Pro forma 2026 equity maybe \~$32B, debt \~$64B, D/E \~2.0×. So the *trend* is reversing. Thus, strictly speaking, Netflix fails the \<0.5 criteria for most of the past decade and likely coming years. It only briefly approached that level in 2022 before re-leveraging. This high debt has been manageable due to strong cash flows, but it’s above conservative thresholds.  
* **Interest Coverage ≥ 3×:** *Pass (recently).* Netflix’s **interest coverage** (EBIT / interest expense) was low during heavy debt buildup but has improved. In 2017–2018, interest expense ($0.24B in 2017, $0.42B in 2018\) was large relative to EBIT ($0.49B, $1.26B), giving coverage \~2.0× and \~3.0× respectively – borderline . By 2020, EBIT $3.20B vs interest \~$0.77B, coverage \~4.2×. In 2022, EBIT $5.26B vs interest \~$0.70B, coverage \~7.5×. In 2024, EBIT \~$9.97B vs interest \~$0.60B, coverage \>16×. So Netflix clearly passes in recent years – it met the ≥3× coverage since 2019\. Even in worst years it was roughly \~2×, which isn’t terrible. But going forward, the new $50B debt will add perhaps \~$2.5B interest annually. If 2026 EBIT \~$15B, coverage \~6× (still \>3). So Netflix seems capable of covering interest comfortably. Thus, on interest coverage, Netflix mostly passes, especially for the last 5 years. In Buffett terms, the business generates enough earnings to pay its interest many times over (which wasn’t true earlier in the decade, but now is).  
* **Interest Exp. / Operating Income ≤ 15%:** *Pass (recent years).* This is another way to view coverage. In 2021, interest expense (\~$0.74B) was \~12.6% of operating income ($5.85B) – passing the ≤15% test. In 2022, $0.71B interest was \~13.4% of $5.26B EBIT – passes . In 2023, $0.66B interest was \~10.7% of $6.20B EBIT – passes well. By 2024, interest \~$0.60B is \~6.0% of $9.97B EBIT – very safe. Historically, in 2017 it was \~49% (fail), 2018 \~34% (fail), 2019 \~34% (fail), 2020 \~24% (just above 15% – fail) . So early on, Netflix failed this metric, but it improved dramatically as profits grew and debt stopped rising. Given Netflix’s current profits and likely refinancing at lower rates in the future (if credit rating stays IG), it should keep interest \<15% of EBIT. So **recent performance passes** and indicates a healthy coverage margin.  
* **Current Ratio \> 1.5:** *Fail.* Netflix’s current ratio has generally been around \~1.0–1.4 and never consistently above 1.5. It was 1.20 in 2015, rose to \~1.4 in 2016, but dipped to \~1.0 by 2019 as content liabilities in current grew. As of Dec 2024, current assets $13.1B vs current liabilities $10.8B, current ratio **1.22** . Netflix deliberately doesn’t carry excess working capital – it keeps cash optimized and content payables are significant (only a portion of content spend is current liability, but it’s large). The company’s operating model (subscription prepayments) actually gives negative working capital (customers often pay monthly in advance, content spend is outflow over time). A current ratio under 1.5 doesn’t worry Netflix given its strong operating cash inflows and access to capital markets. But strictly, it fails the \>1.5 test in most years. It came closest in 2016 (1.40) when cash was boosted by a bond issuance, but generally around \~1.1–1.3. Buffett would view the balance sheet as slightly stretched in terms of liquidity historically, though now with \~$9.6B cash vs $7.3B current content liability (2024) it’s stable. Still, not \>1.5. So a *fail* by that measure.

**5\. Profitability & Efficiency:**

* **Gross Margin ≳ 40%:** *Mostly Pass (recently).* Netflix’s gross margin has improved from \~33% in 2016 to **46% in 2024** . In 2021 it first hit 40% (actually \~41.6%), then dipped to 39.4% in 2022 (just under 40%), then reached 41.5% in 2023 and 46.0% in 2024\. Over 10 years, average gross margin \~37–38%, but trending upward. For the past 3 years, Netflix is around or above the 40% benchmark, except 2022 slightly below. Given the trajectory (management expects gross margin to keep rising as content spend grows slower than revenue), Netflix essentially *passes* here on a forward basis. It’s not a stable consumer-good 50% margin, but 40+% is solid for a media company. In 2025, gross margin is expected to be \~45%. So we’d mark this criterion as **nearly met**, acknowledging one year (2022) was a hair below 40%. Buffett likes consistently high gross margins; Netflix only recently achieved that consistency, so cautious investors might say “almost there.” But current margins indicate a favorable cost structure.  
* **Net Profit Margin ≳ 20%:** *Mixed.* Netflix’s net margin has expanded dramatically, but is just now crossing 20%. From low single-digits a few years ago, it reached **16% in 2023** and **22% in 2024** . That 22% exceeds the 20% threshold. However, over 10 years the average net margin is \~10% and there were many years well below 20%. It only broke 20% in 2024\. Going forward, if Netflix achieves projected operating margins \~31% in 2026 and keeps \~24% net margin, it will consistently pass. But historically, it falls short. A value purist would likely say Netflix didn’t consistently have ≥20% net margin for a full decade – it was \<10% until 2020\. So, *fail on 10-year consistency*. But current performance is at the benchmark. Considering Buffett’s preference for consistently high margins, Netflix is a newcomer to that club. It *passes now, but not for the whole past period*.  
* **ROE ≥ 15% average (10 yrs):** *Pass.* Netflix’s return on equity has been supercharged by its business scaling. In the early years ROE was \<10% (e.g. \~5.5% in 2015 when profits were tiny vs equity) . But the 10-year average ROE is pulled up by recent high figures: 2018 \~23%, 2019 \~25%, 2020 \~25%, 2021 \~32%, 2022 \~21.6%, 2023 \~26.3%, 2024 \~35.2%. The *average of 2015-2024 ROEs* is \~21% (estimating). That is above 15%. Netflix’s ROE in the last 5 years averaged \~26%, which is excellent . This indicates efficient use of equity (partly leveraged by debt). Therefore, on average it passes the ≥15% ROE test. One could argue early years bring the average down, but even including the \~5–7% ROEs of 2015–2016, Netflix’s decade average is still likely around 18–20%. So that’s a *pass*. Importantly, ROE trend is strongly upward – exactly what Buffett likes to see (increasing returns on capital). Netflix’s 2024 ROE of 35% is well above the benchmark, showing it’s a highly profitable company relative to its net worth now.  
* **ROIC ≥ 12% (10-yr avg):** *Borderline/Pass.* Return on invested capital (which adjusts for debt) is a better measure for Netflix given its leverage. Over the past 5–7 years, Netflix’s ROIC steadily climbed and now is \~20% . According to financecharts, Netflix’s 10-year average ROIC is \~13.5% – slightly above 12%. Early in the decade, ROIC was in mid-single digits (heavy content spend suppressed NOPAT relative to capital). But by 2019 ROIC hit \~10%, 2020 \~7% (diluted by big cash build), 2021 \~18%, 2022 \~12%, 2023 \~15%, 2024 \~20% . So the latter half pulls up the average. If Buffett looked at recent years or normalized, he’d see a company earning well above its cost of capital. On a 10-year average basis, \~13–14% ROIC is basically at the threshold. Netflix likely *passes* this criterion by a hair. The direction of ROIC is positive, indicating an economic moat – Netflix can deploy incremental capital at high rates (e.g. the Warner deal is expected to be EPS-accretive by year 2 , suggesting ROIC \> cost of debt). Overall, Netflix’s **ROIC now exceeds 12%**, and the trend suggests it will continue to. On a long-term average, it’s just around the cut-off. We lean this as a pass, given the current trajectory and improvements in capital efficiency.  
* **ROA ≥ 6%:** *Pass.* Return on assets for Netflix has risen above 6% consistently in recent years. After hovering \~3–5% in 2015–2018, ROA hit 7.0% in 2020, 11.5% in 2021, dipped to 9.2% in 2022, and rebounded to 11.1% in 2023, \~16.2% in 2024 . The 10-year average ROA is \~8–9%, above 6%. Netflix meets this easily in the latter half of the decade. Given its asset-light aspects (streaming distribution doesn’t require heavy physical assets beyond content library), ROA has grown as profits grew. Even factoring content assets, ROA in 2024 was 16%, which is excellent. So Netflix clearly *passes* the ≥6% ROA criterion on both average and current basis.  
* **Depreciation / Gross Profit ≤ 10%:** *Fail.* Netflix’s depreciation and amortization (D\&A) relative to gross profit is very high because content amortization (which is akin to depreciation of content assets) is huge. In 2024, D\&A was about $21.0B (cost of revenue) vs gross profit $17.96B , so D\&A was 117% of gross profit – an order of magnitude above 10%. Even excluding content amortization and considering only depreciation of equipment ($0.4B), depreciation was \~2% of gross profit – that would pass. But typically this metric includes all depreciation expense. Netflix’s content amortization is essential and ongoing – the fact it far exceeds gross profit indicates heavy reinvestment. Buffett’s benchmark ≤10% signals a business with low capital intensity (e.g. software). Netflix does not meet this: its **depreciation+amortization consumed almost all gross profit** until recently. Even now, content amortization is \~50% of revenue, meaning D\&A ≈ cost of rev – clearly failing the ≤10% of gross profit test. Netflix’s ratio has improved (from \~170% in 2015 to \~117% in 2024 as margins expanded), but it’s nowhere near 10%. Therefore, Netflix *fails* this criterion by a wide margin. Its business inherently requires large amortization of content investments. A Buffett-style investor might be concerned that reported earnings understate needed reinvestment (which they did historically, as shown by negative FCF while net income was positive). Only very recently has Netflix’s cash generation exceeded its content amortization, but depreciation/gross profit is still far above 10%.

**Verdict:** Netflix meets some of the **“great company” criteria** – particularly in profitability (high ROE/ROIC, improving margins) and now in free cash generation – but **falls short on classic value metrics** of low valuation and smooth historical consistency. It has **exceptional growth and a widening moat**, evidenced by ROIC \>12% and revenue and equity growth \>20%, which are positives under Buffett’s quality tests. However, its **valuation multiples (P/E \~35–45)** are well above value thresholds , offering little margin of safety. And its business, while now generating cash, required heavy reinvestment historically (negative owner’s earnings for many years, depreciation far above 10% of gross profit). Thus, a Buffett-style investor might conclude: Netflix is a **great business franchise (dominant global streamer with high returns on capital)**, but **not a bargain stock** by deep-value standards. It scores well on growth, competitive moat, and improving efficiency – but poorly on conservative balance sheet and cheap valuation. In Buffett’s terms, Netflix might be a **“wonderful company at a not-so-wonderful price.”**

## **DCF Valuation (Intrinsic Value Analysis)**

To estimate Netflix’s intrinsic value, we perform a Discounted Cash Flow analysis under three scenarios: **No-Growth**, **Conservative Growth**, and **Nominal (Average) Growth**. We use Netflix’s Free Cash Flow (FCF) as the basis, discounting at a **10%** required rate of return (approximate cost of equity) and assuming a long-term stable growth in the terminal period of \~3%.

* **Base Inputs:** Netflix’s trailing twelve-month Free Cash Flow (FCF) is about **$6.9 billion** (2024 actual) . However, management projects 2025 FCF around **$9.5 billion** after the WarnerMedia acquisition synergies. We will use $9.5B as the starting FCF, since Netflix is already at a higher run-rate by Q4 2025\. The debt added for Warner ($50B) will increase interest costs but management plans to pay it down quickly from FCF, so we assume the 10% discount rate adequately accounts for that financial risk.

**1\. No-Growth Scenario (Zero FCF Growth):**

In this “steady-state” case, we assume **Netflix’s FCF stays at $9.5 billion annually in perpetuity** with no growth. This essentially treats Netflix as a mature business with flat cash flows. The intrinsic value can be estimated as a perpetuity:

* **FCF (Year 1\)** \= $9.5B (for 2026, using 2025 as forward baseline).  
* **Growth (g)** \= 0% (no growth).  
* **Discount rate (r)** \= 10%.

Using the **Gordon Perpetuity Formula**: Value \= FCF / r (since g=0).

**Intrinsic Value (No-Growth) ≈ $9.5B / 0.10 \= $95 billion**.

This is the enterprise value corresponding to the equity since we’re using post-debt FCF (and assuming Netflix will maintain debt roughly constant). To be precise, as of end-2025 Netflix will have \~$13.8B old debt \+ $50B new \= \~$63.8B debt. But they also have cash and will de-lever, so to avoid complicating, we treat FCF as after interest.

$95B equates to **\~$22 per share** (with \~4.244 billion shares post-split). Compare this to Netflix’s actual market price around $87 – the no-growth DCF implies the market is pricing significant growth.

* **30% Margin of Safety Buy Price:** If we demand a 30% discount, that would be $66.5B ($95B × 0.70) which is \~$15.50 per share. Netflix’s stock has never traded that low (even at 2022 bottom it was equivalent to \~$16.20). So in a no-growth view, Netflix is vastly overvalued – the current price of \~$87 is \~4× the no-growth intrinsic value. However, this scenario is likely too harsh, as Netflix is growing in reality.

**Interpretation:** The no-growth case shows **Netflix’s valuation is not supported by current FCF alone** – it assumes the market expects continued growth. If Netflix’s cash flows flatlined, its fair value might be only \~$95B, far below the actual \~$370B market cap. This provides context for risk: the stock’s high valuation is premised on growth.

**2\. Conservative Growth Scenario (Lowest Growth Rate in past 10 years):**

For a conservative case, we look at Netflix’s **lowest historical growth** as an indicator of a pessimistic future. Netflix’s slowest revenue growth was \~6.5% in 2022 and \~6.7% in 2023 . Free cash flow grew dramatically those years (due to margin expansion), but let’s assume future FCF grows at the low end of revenue growth – say **6% annually** (roughly inflation-level real growth). This scenario might reflect intensified competition or market saturation such that Netflix can only eke out mid-single-digit gains.

* **FCF Year 1 (2026)** \= $9.5B × (1+0.06) \= $10.07B.  
* **Growth (g)** \= 6% for a few years, then we will assume it tapers to a terminal rate of 3% beyond year 5 (conservative long-term).  
* **Discount (r)** \= 10%.

We can do a two-stage DCF: 5 years of 6% growth, then terminal 3% growth.

**Years 1–5 FCF:**

* 2026: $10.07B  
* 2027: $10.68B  
* 2028: $11.32B  
* 2029: $12.00B  
* 2030: $12.72B

We discount each of these back to present (2025 end):

Present Value of FCFs \= $\\sum\_{t=1}^{5} \\frac{FCF\_t}{(1.10)^t}$:

* PV(2026 FCF) \= $10.07 / 1.10^1 \= $9.15B  
* PV(2027) \= $10.68 / 1.10^2 \= $8.83B  
* PV(2028) \= $11.32 / 1.10^3 \= $8.52B  
* PV(2029) \= $12.00 / 1.10^4 \= $8.22B  
* PV(2030) \= $12.72 / 1.10^5 \= $7.94B

Sum of PV (years 1–5) ≈ **$42.66B**.

**Terminal Value (start of 2031):** We use FCF 2031 \= $12.72B × (1+0.03) \= $13.10B as the first year of terminal, with g=3%. Terminal Value \= $\\frac{13.10B}{(0.10 \- 0.03)} \= $187.14B. Discount this back 5 years: PV(Terminal) \= $187.14 / 1.10^5 \= $116.31B.

**Total Present Value (Enterprise Equity Value)** \= $42.66B \+ $116.31B \= **$158.97 billion**.

Rounding, say **\~$160 billion intrinsic equity value** under this conservative 6% growth case.

This equates to **\~$37.80 per share** (160B / 4.244B shares).

* **Margin of Safety Price (30% off)** \= 0.70 × $160B \= **$112 billion**, which is $26.50 per share. Netflix’s current price ($87) is much higher, so it does not hit a 30% MOS here either.

However, note this scenario might be *very conservative*, since Netflix is currently growing FCF much faster (FCF was $1.6B in 2022 to $6.9B in 2023 – though that pace won’t continue linearly). We basically assumed Netflix’s future growth slows to \~6% soon and forever after 5 years goes to 3%. If that were true, the DCF suggests Netflix is overvalued by about 2.3× (market $370B vs intrinsic $160B).

Yet, even this conservative scenario yields a value ($160B) higher than the no-growth scenario ($95B), showing the impact of even modest growth.

**3\. Nominal Growth Scenario (Average Growth Case):**

For a more optimistic but reasonable case, we use Netflix’s **average growth of the past 10 years** as an indicator. Historically revenue grew \~21% CAGR (2014–2024), but that’s decelerating. Free cash flow turned positive recently, growing wildly from $1.6B to $6.9B (2022–23) – not sustainable long-term. Instead, we’ll project based on a plausible average FCF growth going forward. Let’s assume **Free Cash Flow grows \~14% annually for the next 5 years** (this is roughly the midpoint of recent revenue growth and takes into account margin expansion). Thereafter, we use a conservative terminal growth of 4% (a bit above inflation, reflecting continued global pricing power and new initiatives like advertising/gaming).

* **FCF Year 1 (2026)** \= $9.5B × 1.14 \= $10.83B.  
* Growth 14% through 2030, then terminal 4%.

**Years 1–5 FCF:**

* 2026: $10.83B  
* 2027: $12.34B  
* 2028: $14.07B  
* 2029: $16.04B  
* 2030: $18.29B

Discounting each:

* PV(2026) \= $10.83 / 1.10 \= $9.85B  
* PV(2027) \= $12.34 / 1.10^2 \= $10.20B  
* PV(2028) \= $14.07 / 1.10^3 \= $10.56B  
* PV(2029) \= $16.04 / 1.10^4 \= $10.93B  
* PV(2030) \= $18.29 / 1.10^5 \= $11.33B

Sum PV (2026–30) \= **$52.87B**.

**Terminal Value (start 2031):** FCF 2031 \= $18.29B × 1.04 \= $19.02B. Terminal Value at 4% growth \= $19.02 / (0.10 \- 0.04) \= $19.02 / 0.06 \= **$317.0 billion**. PV(Terminal) \= $317.0 / 1.10^5 \= $197.0B.

Total Present Equity Value \= $52.87B \+ $197.0B \= **$249.9 billion** (call it $250B).

That equals about **$58.90 per share**.

This implies that if Netflix can grow FCF \~14% for 5 years and then moderately thereafter, its intrinsic value is around $250B. The current market cap \~$370B is notably higher, indicating the market might be pricing even more optimistic growth or lower discount rate.

* **Buy Price with 30% MOS:** 0.70 × $250B \= **$175 billion**, which is \~$41.20 per share. The stock ($87) is well above that, so no margin of safety.

Comparing scenarios:

* No-growth value $95B ($22/share).  
* Conservative (6% growth) $160B ($38/share).  
* Nominal (14% then taper) $250B ($59/share).

Netflix’s **actual market cap \~$370B ($87/share)** is above even our optimistic DCF. This suggests the market expects **more than 14% FCF growth for longer**, or a lower required return. For instance, if we extended 14% growth for 10 years, value would jump a lot. Alternatively, perhaps the market is assuming the Warner acquisition will boost cash flows significantly beyond our conservative estimates.

**Intrinsic Value Estimates:**

* **No Growth IV:** ≈ **$95 billion** (≈$22/share). *Investors would demand a price \~$15/share for 30% MOS – far below current levels.*  
* **Conservative IV (g=6%):** ≈ **$160 billion** (\~$38/share). *30% MOS price ≈$26/share.*  
* **Nominal IV (g≈14%→4%):** ≈ **$250 billion** (\~$59/share). *30% MOS price ≈$41/share.*

Netflix’s current stock price \~$87 is above even the nominal intrinsic value ($59). Therefore, by DCF, the stock appears **overvalued** unless Netflix greatly exceeds the “conservative” growth or one uses a lower discount rate (e.g. 8% cost of capital would raise the DCF values considerably, perhaps justifying \~$80-90/share). One might argue Netflix’s cost of capital is lower now that it’s an established, investment-grade company – if we used 8% instead of 10%, the nominal case intrinsic value would be \~$360B (close to market). But sticking to 10% (Buffett’s standard hurdle), **Netflix does not offer a margin of safety at its current valuation**.

In conclusion, the DCF analysis suggests **Netflix’s stock is pricing in substantial growth**. The **No-Growth scenario yields a very low value**, underscoring that Netflix’s valuation is built on future expansion. The **Conservative scenario**($160B) is \~57% of the market cap – implying the market is more optimistic than our low-growth case. The **Nominal scenario** ($250B) still falls short of the $370B market price, indicating limited or no margin of safety. Only with *very aggressive assumptions* (e.g. \>20% FCF CAGR for many years) would one justify the current price. Value investors seeking a 30% MOS would likely need Netflix’s stock to be in the **$25–$40 range**, which is far below today’s levels and highly unlikely barring a major collapse. Thus, from a strict DCF value perspective, Netflix appears **overvalued**, or at best fully valued, relative to conservative intrinsic worth estimates. Investors are effectively betting on Netflix’s extraordinary future – the DCF suggests caution if one requires a margin of safety.

## **Key Metrics Charts**

*(Chart: Netflix’s 10-Year Revenue and Net Income Growth.* Netflix’s revenue rose from $6.8 B in 2015 to $39 B in 2024, a \~5.7× increase . Net income (green line) surged even more, from $122 M to $8.71 B . The red dashed line is the 10-year average growth rate \~28% for revenue and \~65% for net income, while yellow markers denote 2024 highs. The trend illustrates expanding profitability, as net income grew faster than revenue, reflecting margin expansion.)\*

*(Chart: Netflix’s Valuation Multiples History.* The blue line shows Netflix’s P/E ratio each year-end, which peaked above 400× in 2015 and declined to \~29× in 2022 before rising to 44× in 2024 . The orange line is P/B ratio, which ranged 16–23× for many years, dipped to \~6.3× in 2022, and is \~15.7× in 2024 . The red dashed lines mark value-investor benchmarks (P/E 15×, P/B 1.5×). Clearly, Netflix traded far above traditional value thresholds, only moving closer during the 2022 crash. The recent uptick in multiples (2023–24) shows renewed growth optimism priced in.)\*

*(Chart: Profit Margins and Returns.* Netflix’s operating margin (purple area) expanded from \~2–4% in mid-2010s to **25.5%** in 2024 . Net margin (green area) reached **22.3%** in 2024 . The red line shows ROE, which climbed from single digits to **35%** in 2024 . The yellow line is ROIC, rising from \~4% to **20%** in 2024 . The dashed red line indicates Buffett’s preferred thresholds (20% margin, 15% ROE, 12% ROIC). Netflix only crossed these in recent years, demonstrating improved efficiency and a strengthening moat.)\*
