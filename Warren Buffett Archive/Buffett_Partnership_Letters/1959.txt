1959 Partnership Letter
-----------------------
Buffett described 1959 as a year when the stock market was “very peculiar” because the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose modestly while most stocks actually declined.  He noted that a few large companies with speculative appeal propped up the index, creating a false impression of general prosperity【758433665114640†L1-L47】.  Buffett cautioned that many so‑called blue‑chip stocks were priced well above their intrinsic value and warned that these securities could experience severe declines【758433665114640†L39-L47】.  His partnerships achieved gains ranging from roughly 22 % to 30 %, again exceeding the Dow, and he explained that this was accomplished through careful selection of undervalued securities and arbitrage situations rather than by following market trends【758433665114640†L1-L47】.
