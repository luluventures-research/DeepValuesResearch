1962 Partnership Letters
------------------------
**January 24, 1962 – Our Performance in 1961.**  Buffett reviewed 1961 results, noting that the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 22.2 % while the partnership achieved a 45.9 % gain, resulting in an advantage of more than twenty percentage points【360743025462578†L0-L90】.  He told partners that the Dow should be used as the yardstick for evaluating results and cautioned that the partnership would sometimes underperform the index in strong markets.  Buffett provided a detailed table of annual and cumulative performance for 1957‑1961 and explained that partners should focus on long‑term results rather than short‑term fluctuations【360743025462578†L0-L90】.

**July 6, 1962 – A Reminder.**  In a mid‑year letter Buffett reprinted a section titled “And a Prediction” from his January letter, emphasizing that he did not predict general market movements and expected the Dow to return about five to seven percent annually over the long term.  He wrote that the partnership’s best years relative to the Dow would likely occur when the market declined or moved sideways and pointed out that during the first half of 1962 the partnership declined 7.5 % while the Dow fell 21.7 %【684449794172205†L0-L104】.

**November 1, 1962 – Administration & Dempster.**  The third letter of 1962 asked partners to sign revised partnership agreements for 1963 and discussed progress in the restructuring of Dempster Mill.  Buffett noted that the partnership had gained 5.5 % through October, compared with a 16.8 % decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and cautioned that such large margins over the Dow were abnormal【851364908307259†L3-L90】.  He emphasised that partners should focus on the long term and avoid being misled by short‑term exceptional results.
