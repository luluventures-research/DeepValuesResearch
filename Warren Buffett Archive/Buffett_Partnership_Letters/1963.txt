1963 Partnership Letters
------------------------
**January 18, 1963 – The Ground Rules.**  Buffett’s long January 1963 letter spelled out the partnership’s ground rules and investment categories.  He explained that he could not guarantee annual returns and that results should be judged relative to the Dow Jones Industrial Average over five‑year intervals【611133643779641†L0-L71】.  The partnership pursued three types of investments: “generals” (undervalued securities where Buffett sought a margin of safety), “work‑outs” (special situations involving mergers, liquidations or reorganisations), and “control” situations where the partnership could influence management【611133643779641†L172-L174】.  Buffett reviewed 1962 performance (13.9 % gain versus a 7.6 % decline in the Dow) and provided a detailed table of annual results since 1957【819423945863030†L2521-L2572】.  He described the partnership’s investment in Dempster Mill, where the partnership bought control, replaced management and sold off assets to realise value.

**July 10, 1963 – First Half Performance.**  Buffett reported that the partnership gained about 14 % in the first half of 1963 compared with a 10 % rise in the Dow.  He explained that performance was again led by undervalued securities and that differences versus the Dow were modest【323261192480282†L3-L37】.  He cautioned that periods of underperformance would occur and that partners should not expect consistent outperformance each year.

**November 6, 1963 – Administrative.**  A brief November letter asked partners to return commitment letters for 1964 and noted that the partnership had gained about 32 % through October versus an 18.8 % gain in the Dow【417657988747005†L4-L71】.  Buffett remarked that such large margins over the Dow were unusual and again emphasised long‑term evaluation.

**December 26, 1963 – Tax Matters.**  The December letter provided tax guidance to partners.  It instructed them not to report partnership distributions as income for federal income tax purposes and advised them to pay 1964 quarterly tax based on their actual 1963 tax to avoid penalties.  Buffett estimated that partners’ capital accounts would increase by roughly 20 % (for those taking monthly payments) or 26 % (for those taking no payments) for 1963【819423945863030†L4208-L4268】.
