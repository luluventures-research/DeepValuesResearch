1967 Partnership Letters
------------------------
**January 25, 1967 – The First Decade.**  Buffett reviewed 1966 results, showing that the partnership gained 20.4 % versus a 15.6 % decline in the Dow【71515045387443†L0-L149】.  He presented a ten‑year table of cumulative results (1957‑1966) and noted that finding bargains had become harder as more analysts adopted value investing techniques.  Buffett observed that purely statistical bargains were disappearing and that future decisions would place greater emphasis on qualitative judgments【71515045387443†L0-L149】.

**July 12, 1967 – First Half Performance.**  The partnership gained about 21 % in the first half of 1967 compared with an 11.4 % rise in the Dow【355442416903321†L0-L118】.  Buffett discussed the performance of controlled companies, including Berkshire Hathaway and Diversified Retailing, and noted that their improvement contributed meaningfully to results.  He again warned that future opportunities might be limited and that partners should not expect continued double‑digit margins over the Dow【355442416903321†L0-L118】.

**October 9, 1967 – Changing Yardsticks.**  Buffett wrote a long letter explaining why he was altering performance yardsticks.  He cited the disappearance of statistical bargains, the increasing size of partnership assets, and his growing personal interests.  He explained that decisions would rely more on judgment than on simple quantitative analysis and that the partnership’s results might diverge more from the Dow【922008250293169†L12-L69】.
