1969 Partnership Letters
------------------------
**January 22, 1969 – Our Performance in 1968.**  Buffett reported an exceptional 58.8 % gain for 1968 compared with a 7.7 % rise in the Dow and called the result a “freak” that could not be expected to recur【206189355090927†L0-L156】.  He explained that a combination of undervalued securities, special situations and the strong performance of controlled companies produced the huge margin.  Buffett reminded partners that unusually good years often follow mediocre years and vice versa, and he cautioned that future returns would likely be lower.

**May 29, 1969 – Liquidation Announcement.**  In May Buffett announced that he would retire and that the partnership would be liquidated.  He cited three reasons: a lack of investment bargains after a decade of success, the partnership’s large asset base, and personal considerations【617764304850509†L6-L41】.  He told partners that he would help arrange the sale of assets and recommended Bill Ruane as a future money manager for those who wished to invest with someone sharing similar principles.  Buffett explained that partners could choose to receive cash or shares in Berkshire Hathaway or Diversified Retailing.

**October 9, 1969 – Liquidation Calendar.**  In October Buffett sent a detailed schedule for the liquidation process.  He reported that cash distributions would begin soon and that the partnership’s investments would be transferred or sold as appropriate【100882578348246†L4-L41】.  He again endorsed Bill Ruane for those seeking professional management and provided guidance on how to handle shares of Berkshire and Diversified Retailing.

**December 5, 1969 – Controlled Company Update.**  This letter provided a detailed description of the partnership’s two controlled companies, Diversified Retailing and Berkshire Hathaway.  Buffett explained that Diversified Retailing sold Hochschild, Kohn & Co., while Berkshire continued to operate its textile division and to expand its insurance and banking operations【49056789344508†L14-L47】.  He also provided updated net asset values and described the prospects for each business.

**December 26, 1969 – Cash Distribution.**  The final 1969 letter announced that partners would receive a cash distribution equal to roughly 64 % of their January 1, 1969 capital accounts.  Buffett answered frequently asked questions about taxation, the timing of distributions and the handling of Berkshire shares【782703015069146†L4-L18】.
