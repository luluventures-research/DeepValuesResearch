1958 Partnership Letter
-----------------------
The 1958 letter was written after a year in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 38.5 %, one of the largest advances in its history.  Buffett wrote that his partnerships slightly exceeded this gain and that their results were achieved by purchasing undervalued securities rather than chasing market favorites【814626904370813†L23-L51】.  He cautioned partners that when the general market is rising rapidly, comparisons with the Dow can be misleading and that the partnership’s objective remains to outperform in the long run through fundamental analysis.  The letter contains a detailed case study of Commonwealth Trust, explaining why he purchased the stock and later sold it after its price approached intrinsic value【814626904370813†L53-L99】.  Buffett emphasised that the partnership had no intention of forecasting market moves and instead sought bargains in undervalued companies that could be worth more under different management or capital structures【814626904370813†L23-L51】.
