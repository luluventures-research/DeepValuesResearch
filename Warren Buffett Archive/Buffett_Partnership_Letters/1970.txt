Buffett explained the mechanics of settlement and encouraged partners to take time to learn about bonds before committing funds.

**April 3, 1970 – Berkshire Hathaway Shareholder Letter.**  The April letter, written by Berkshire Hathaway’s president Ken Chace, reported on Berkshire’s operations.  It explained that the company was moving away from textiles and focusing on acquiring profitable businesses.  The letter described the improved results of Berkshire’s insurance subsidiary (National Indemnity) and the performance of its bank, the Illinois National Bank and Trust Company of Rockford【71198313529242†L0-L63】.  Although not strictly a partnership letter, this communication was sent to former partners who remained shareholders in Berkshire and marked the end of Buffett’s early correspondence era.
