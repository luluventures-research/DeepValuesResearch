1956 – Partnership Origins
----------------------------
Warren Buffett organized his investment partnerships in 1956.  There is no known annual letter from 1956.  The earliest surviving communication is the 1957 letter sent to partners, so this file serves only to note that the partnership began operations in 1956.
