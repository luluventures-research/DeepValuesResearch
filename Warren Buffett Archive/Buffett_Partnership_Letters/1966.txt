1966 Partnership Letters
------------------------
**January 20, 1966 – Our Performance in 1965.**  Buffett reported that the partnership gained 47.2 % in 1965 while the Dow rose 14.2 %, producing one of the widest margins to date【208907263309020†L0-L133】.  He cautioned that such a large advantage was unlikely to be repeated.  Buffett reviewed the results of each investment category and noted that the partnership’s share of Berkshire Hathaway stock accounted for a large part of the gain.  He reminded partners that the partnership’s focus remained on intrinsic value and risk minimisation.

**July 12, 1966 – First Half Performance.**  In mid‑1966 the partnership gained 8.2 % while the Dow declined 8.7 %, again showing a wide margin【196357381874193†L0-L99】.  Buffett emphasised that results were abnormal because stock prices fell sharply and undervalued issues held up better.  He compared the partnership’s results to those of leading mutual funds and pointed out that all funds had lost money.  Buffett reiterated that investors should not expect such large margins over the market in the future【196357381874193†L0-L99】.
