1961 Semi‑Annual Letter (July)
-----------------------------
Buffett sent a semi‑annual letter in July 1961 at the request of partners who wanted more frequent communication.  He reported that the partnership performed better than the Dow in the first half of 1961 but warned that short‑term measurements could be misleading.  He emphasised that results should be measured over five‑year periods and noted that if the market continued to rise rapidly, the partnership might trail the index【184903657680732†L20-L50】.  Buffett wrote that he had undertaken a significant new investment that he hoped would remain dormant for years and ultimately yield substantial profits—an early hint of his future control purchases【184903657680732†L20-L50】.  The letter also discussed progress toward consolidating all partnerships and provided proposed terms for the unified partnership, including profit division, interest provisions and rights to withdraw funds【184903657680732†L53-L140】.
