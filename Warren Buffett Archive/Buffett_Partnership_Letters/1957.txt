1957 Partnership Letter
-----------------------
In his first surviving letter to limited partners, Buffett wrote that the general stock market level appeared high and that he saw a possibility of a general decline in stock prices.  He emphasised that his partnership focused on undervalued securities and resisted predictions about overall market moves【312852529905338†L0-L39】.  The letter noted that the portfolio was heavier in undervalued situations relative to the previous year and that Buffett divided holdings into “generals” (undervalued securities), “work‑outs” (investments tied to specific corporate events), and arbitrage/control situations【312852529905338†L0-L133】.  He explained that during 1956 his portfolio had shifted from a roughly 70‑30 split between general issues and work‑outs to about 85‑15, reflecting greater opportunities among undervalued issues【312852529905338†L0-L133】.  Buffett warned that high market levels could produce declines in blue‑chip stocks but would not necessarily harm his work‑out investments, and he stressed that the partnership’s objective was to achieve a high rate of return with minimal risk rather than to forecast broad market movements【312852529905338†L0-L39】.
