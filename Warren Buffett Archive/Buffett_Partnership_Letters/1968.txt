1968 Partnership Letters
------------------------
**January 24, 1968 – Our Performance in 1967.**  Buffett reported that the partnership gained 35.9 % in 1967 versus a 19.0 % gain in the Dow【319665903507092†L0-L84】.  He cautioned that 1967 was an unusually good year when many investors beat the index and noted that the partnership’s margin over the Dow was unlikely to be repeated.  Buffett described how controlled companies contributed to results and emphasised that his partners should remain realistic about future returns.

**July 11, 1968 – First Half Performance.**  In the first half of 1968 the partnership gained 16 % while the Dow rose less than 1 %【923473292647224†L0-L122】.  Buffett wrote that he continued to find few bargain securities and that performance was driven largely by controlled companies and special situations.  He also mentioned that a report on Diversified Retailing would be issued later in the year and reminded partners that short‑term results were not indicative of long‑term expectations【923473292647224†L0-L122】.

**Note:**  A November 1968 letter is referenced in some lists but was not available; it may have been an administrative note.
