1960 Partnership Letter
-----------------------
In 1960 the stock market declined, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling 6.3 %.  Buffett reported that his partnership gained 22.8 % despite the general decline and that the partnership had beaten the Dow in each year since inception【730217087184235†L13-L84】.  He stated that his objective was not to beat the market every year but to outperform it by about ten percentage points on average over long periods.  Buffett announced plans to consolidate several separate partnerships into a single partnership and detailed proposed terms, including a profit‑sharing formula in which he would receive a percentage of the profits above a 4 % annual threshold【730217087184235†L123-L144】.  The letter also noted that superior performance could not be expected every year and that periods of underperformance relative to the Dow were inevitable【730217087184235†L13-L84】.
